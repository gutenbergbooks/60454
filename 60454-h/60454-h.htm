Robin Hood of England. They say many young gentlemen flock

<p class="dropcap">We may be sure the memory
of many a Cavalier went
back to that sweetest of
all Pastorals, Shakespeare’s
Comedy of “As You Like
It,” while he clutched to
his breast the precious little
volume of <i>Choyce Drollery,
Songs and Sonnets</i>, which
was newly published in the year 1656. He sought
a covert amid the yellowing fronds of fern, in some
old park that had not yet been wholly confiscated
by the usurping Commonwealth; where, under the
broad shadow of a beech-tree, with the squirrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
watching him curiously from above, and timid
fawns sniffing at him suspiciously a few yards distant,
he might again yield himself to the enjoyment of
reading “heroick Drayton’s” <i>Dowsabell</i>, the love-tale
beginning with the magic words “Farre in the Forest
of Arden”—an invocative name which summoned to
his view the Rosalind whose praise was carved on
many a tree. He also, be it remembered, had “a
banished Lord;” even then remote from his native
Court, associating with “co-mates and brothers in
exile”—somewhat different in mood from Amiens or
the melancholy Jacques; and, alas! not devoid of
feminine companions. Enough resemblance was in
the situation for a fanciful enthusiasm to lend enchantment
to the name of Arden (<a href="#Page_73">p. 73</a>), and recall
scenes of shepherd-life with Celia, the songs that
echoed “Under the greenwood-tree;” without needing
the additional spell of seeing “Ingenious Shakespeare”
mentioned among “the Time-Poets” on the
fifth page of <i>Choyce Drollery</i>.</p>

<p>Not easily was the book obtained; every copy at
that time being hunted after, and destroyed when
found, by ruthless minions of the Commonwealth.
A Parliamentary injunction had been passed against
it. Commands were given for it to be burnt by the
hangman. Few copies escaped, when spies and informers
were numerous, and fines were levied upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
those who had secreted it. Greedy eyes, active fingers,
were after the <i>Choyce Drollery</i>. Any fortunate
possessor, even in those early days, knew well that he
grasped a treasure which few persons save himself
could boast. Therefore it is not strange, two hundred
and twenty years having rolled away since then, that
the book has grown to be among the rarest of the
<i>Drolleries</i>. Probably not six perfect copies remain in
the world. The British Museum holds not one. We
congratulate ourselves on restoring it now to students,
for many parts of it possess historical value, besides
poetic grace; and the whole work forms an interesting
relic of those troubled times.</p>

<p>Unlike our other <i>Drolleries</i>, reproduced <i>verbatim et
literatim</i> in this series, we here find little describing
the last days of Cromwell and the Commonwealth;
except one graphic picture of a despoiled West-Countryman
(<a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>), complaining against both
Roundheads and “Cabbaleroes.” The poems were
not only composed before hopes revived of speedy
Restoration for the fugitive from Worcester-fight and
Boscobel; they were, in great part, written before the
Civil Wars began. Few of them, perhaps, were previously
in print (the title-page asserts that <i>none</i> had
been so, but we know this to be false). Publishers
made such statements audaciously, then as now, and
forced truth to limp behind them without chance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
overtaking. By far the greater number belonged to
an early date in the reign of the murdered King,
chiefly about the year 1637; two, at the least, were
written in the time of James I. (viz., <a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>, a contemporary
poem on the Gunpowder Plot of 1605;
and, <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>, the Ballad on King James I.), if not
also the still earlier one, on the Defeat of the Scots at
Muscleborough Field; which is probably corrupted
from an original so remote as the reign of Edward VI.
“Dowsabell” was certainly among the <i>Pastorals</i> of
1593, and “Down lay the Shepherd’s swain” (<a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>)
bears token of belonging to an age when the Virgin
Queen held sway. These facts guide to an understanding
of the charm held by <i>Choyce Drollery</i> for
adherents of the Monarchy; and of its obnoxiousness
in the sight of the Parliament that had slain their
King. It was not because of any exceptional immorality
in this <i>Choyce Drollery</i> that it became denounced;
although such might be declared in proclamations.
Other books of the same year offended
worse against morals: for example, the earliest
edition known to us of <i>Wit and Drollery</i>, with the
extremely “free” <i>facetiæ</i> of <i>Sportive Wit, or Lusty
Drollery</i> (both works issued in 1656), held infinitely
more to shock proprieties and call for repression.
The <i>Musarum Deliciæ</i> of Sir J[ohn] M[ennis] and
Dr. J[ames] S[mith], in the same year, 1656, cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
be held blameless. Yet the hatred shewn towards
<i>Choyce Drollery</i> far exceeded all the rancour against
these bolder sinners, or the previous year’s delightful
miscellany of merriment and true poetry, the <i>Wit’s
Interpreter</i> of industrious J[ohn] C[otgrave]; to
whom, despite multitudinous typographical errors, we
owe thanks, both for <i>Wit’s Interpreter</i> and for the
wilderness of dramatic beauties, his <i>Wit’s Treasury</i>:
bearing the same date of 1655.</p>

<p>It was not because of sins against taste and public
or private morals, (although, we admit, it has some few
of these, sufficient to afford a pretext for persecutors,
who would have been equally bitter had it possessed
virginal purity:) but in consequence of other and more
dangerous ingredients, that <i>Choyce Drollery</i> aroused
such a storm. Not disgust, but fear of its influence
in reviving loyalty, prompted the order of its extermination.
Readers at this later day, might easily fail to
notice all that stirred the loyal sentiments of chivalric
devotion, and consequently made the fierce Fifth-Monarchy
men hate the small volume worse than the
<i>Apocrypha</i> or <i>Ikon Basilike</i>. Herein was to be found the
clever “Jack of Lent’s” account of loyal preparations
made in London to receive the newly-wedded Queen,
Henrietta Maria, when she came from France, in
1625, escorted by the Duke of Buckingham, who
compromised her sister by his rash attentions: Buckingham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
whom King Charles loved so well that the
favouritism shook his throne, even after Felton’s
dagger in 1628 had rid the land of the despotic courtier.
Here, also, a more grievous offence to the
Regicides, was still recorded in austere grandeur of
verse, from no common hireling pen, but of some
scholar like unto Henry King, of Chichester, the loyal
“New-Year’s Wish” (<a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>) presented to King
Charles at the beginning of 1638, when the North
was already in rebellion: wherein men read, what at
that time had not been deemed profanity or blasphemy,
the praise and faithful service of some hearts
who held their monarch only second to their Saviour.
Referring to their hope that the personal approach of
the King might cure the evils of the disturbed realm,
it is written:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“You, like our sacred and indulgent Lord,</div>
<div class="verse">When the too-stout Apostle drew his sword,</div>
<div class="verse">When he mistooke some secrets of the cause,</div>
<div class="verse">And in his furious zeale disdained the Lawes,</div>
<div class="verse">Forgetting true Religion doth lye</div>
<div class="verse">On prayers, not swords against authority:</div>
<div class="verse">You, like our substitute of horrid fate,</div>
<div class="verse">That are next Him we most should imitate,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall like to Him rebuke with wiser breath,</div>
<div class="verse">Such furious zeale, but not reveng’d with death.</div>
<div class="verse">Like him, the wound that’s giv’n you strait shall heal</div>
<div class="verse">Then calm by precept such mistaking zeal.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span></p>

<p>Here was a sincere, unflinching recognition of Divine
Right, such as the faction in power could not possibly
abide. Even the culpable weakness and ingratitude
of Charles, in abandoning Strafford, Laud, and other
champions to their unscrupulous destroyers, had not
made true-hearted Cavaliers falter in their faith to
him. As the best of moralists declares:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent8">“Love is not love</div>
<div class="verse">Which alters when it alteration finds,</div>
<div class="verse">Or bends with the remover to remove.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These loyal sentiments being embodied in print
within our <i>Choyce Drollery</i>, suitable to sustain the
fealty of the defeated Cavaliers to the successor of the
“Royal Martyr,” it was evident that the Restoration
must be merely a question of time. “If it be now,
’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now;
if it be not now, <i>yet it will come: the readiness is all</i>!”</p>

<p>To more than one of those who had sat in the ill-constituted
and miscalled High Court of Justice,
during the closing days of 1648-9, there must have
been, ever and anon, as the years rolled by, a shuddering
recollection of the words written anew upon
the wall in characters of living fire. They had shown
themselves familiar, in one sense much too familiar,
with the phraseology but not the teaching of Scripture.
To them the <i>Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin</i> needed no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
Daniel come to judgment for interpretation. The
Banquet was not yet over; the subjugated people, whom
they had seduced from their allegiance by a dream of
winning freedom from exactions, were still sullenly
submissive; the desecrated cups and challices of the
Church they had despoiled, believing it overthrown
for ever, had been, in many cases, melted down for
plunder,—in others, sold as common merchandize:
and yet no thunder heard. But, however defiantly
they might bear themselves, however resolute to crush
down every attempt at revolt against their own authority,
the men in power could not disguise from
one another that there were heavings of the earth on
which they trod, coming from no reverberations of
their footsteps, but telling of hollowness and insecurity
below. They were already suspicious among themselves,
no longer hiding personal spites and jealousies,
the separate ambition of uncongenial factions, which
had only united for a season against the monarchy
and hierarchy, but now began to fall asunder, mutually
envenomed and intolerant. Presbyterian, Independent,
and Nondescript-Enthusiast, while combined
together of late, had been acknowledged as a power
invincible, a Three-fold Cord that bound the helpless
Victim to an already bloody altar. The strands of it
were now unwinding, and there scarcely needed much
prophetic wisdom to discern that one by one they
could soon be broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>

<p>To us, from these considerations, there is intense
attraction in the <i>Choyce Drollery</i>, since it so narrowly
escaped from flames to which it had been judicially
condemned.</p>

<h3 id="INTRODUCTION_2">§ 2.—<span class="smcap">The Two Courts, in 1656.</span></h3>

<p>At this date many a banished or self-exiled Royalist,
dwelling in the Low Countries, but whose heart remained
in England, drew a melancholy contrast between
the remembered past of Whitehall and the
gloomy present. With honest Touchstone, he could
say, “Now am I in Arden! the more fool I. When I
was at home I was in a better place; but travellers
must be content.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the beloved Warwickshire glades,
herds of swine were routing noisily for acorns, dropped
amid withered leaves under branches of the Royal
Oaks. They were watched by boys, whose chins
would not be past the first callow down of promissory
beards when Restoration-day should come with shouts
of welcome throughout the land.</p>

<p>In 1656 our Charles Stuart was at Bruges, now
and then making a visit to Cologne, often getting into
difficulties through the misconduct of his unruly followers,
and already quite enslaved by Dalilahs, syrens
against whom his own shrewd sense was powerless to
defend him. For amusement he read his favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
French or Italian authors, not seldom took long walks,
and indulged himself in field sports:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>A merry monarch, scandalous and poor</i>.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For he was only scantily supplied with money, which
chiefly came from France, but if he had possessed the
purse of Fortunatus it could barely have sufficed to
meet demands from those who lived upon him. A
year before, the Lady Byron had been spoken of as
being his seventeenth Mistress abroad, and there was
no deficiency of candidates for any vacant place within
his heart. Sooth to say, the place was never vacant,
for it yielded at all times unlimited accommodation
to every beauty. Music and dances absorbed much
of his attention. So long as the faces around him
showed signs of happiness, he did not seriously afflict
himself because he was in exile, and a little out at
elbows.</p>

<p>Such was the “Banished Duke” in his Belgian
Court; poor substitute for the Forest of Ardennes,
not far distant. By all accounts, he felt “the penalty
of Adam, the season’s difference,” and in no way
relished the discomfort. He did not smile and say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“This is no flattery: these are counsellors</div>
<div class="verse">That feelingly persuade me what I am.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For, in truth, he much preferred avoiding such counsel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
and relished flattery too well to part with it on
cheap terms. He never considered the “rural life
more sweet than that of painted pomp,” and, if all
tales of Cromwell’s machinations be held true, Charles
by no means found the home of exile “more free
from peril than the envious court.” On the other
hand, his own proclamation, dated 3rd May, 1654,
offering an annuity of five hundred pounds, a
Colonelcy and Knighthood, to any person who should
destroy the Usurper (“a certain mechanic fellow, by
name Oliver Cromwell!”), took from him all moral
right of complaint against reprisals: unless, as we
half-believe, this proclamation were one of the many
forgeries. As to any sweetness in “the uses of
Adversity,” Charles might have pleaded, with a laugh,
that he had known sufficient of them already to be
cloyed with it.</p>

<p>The men around him were of similar opinion. A
few, indeed, like Cowley and Crashaw, were loyal
hearts, whose devotion was best shown in times of
difficulty. Not many proved of such sound metal,
but there lived some “faithful found among the faithless”;
and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent5">“He that can endure</div>
<div class="verse">To follow with allegiance a fallen lord,</div>
<div class="verse">Does conquer him that did his master conquer,</div>
<div class="verse">And earns a place in the story.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The Ladies of the party scarcely cared for anything
beyond self-adornment, rivalry, languid day-dreams of
future greatness, and the encouragement of gallantry.</p>

<p>There was not one among them who for a moment
can bear comparison with the Protector’s daughter,
Elizabeth Claypole—perhaps the loveliest female
character of all recorded in those years. Everything
concerning her speaks in praise. She was the good
angel of the house. Her father loved her, with something
approaching reverence, and feared to forfeit
her conscientious approval more than the support of
his companions in arms. In worship she shrank from
the profane familiarity of the Sectaries, and devotedly
held by the Church of England. She is recorded
to have always used her powerful influence in behalf
of the defeated Cavaliers, to obtain mercy and forbearance.
Her name was whispered, with blessing
implored upon it, in the prayers of many whom she
alone had saved from death.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> No personal ambition,
no foolish pride and ostentation marked her short
career. The searching glare of Court publicity could
betray no flaw in her conduct or disposition; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
heart was sound within, her religion was devoid of all
hypocrisy. Her Christian purity was too clearly stainless
for detraction to dare raise one murmur. She is
said to have warmly pleaded in behalf of Doctor
Hewit, who died upon the scaffold with his Royalist
companion, Sir Harry Slingsby, the 8th of June, 1658
(although she rejoiced in the defeat of their plot, as
her extant letter proves). Cromwell resisted her
solicitations, urged to obduracy by his more ruthless
Ironsides, who called for terror to be stricken into
the minds of all reactionists by wholesale slaughter of
conspirators. Soon after this she faded. It was
currently reported and believed that on her death-bed,
amid the agonies and fever-fits, she bemoaned the
blood that had been shed, and spoke reproaches to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
the father whom she loved, so that his conscience
smote him, and the remembrance stayed with him for
ever.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> She was only twenty-nine when at Hampton
Court she died, on the 6th of August, 1658. Less
than a month afterwards stout Oliver’s heart broke.
Something had gone from him, which no amount of
power and authority could counter-balance. He was
not a man to breathe his deeper sorrows into the ear
of those political adventurers or sanctified enthusiasts
whose glib tongues could rattle off the words of consolation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
While she was slowly dying he had still
tried to grapple with his serious duties, as though
undisturbed. Her prayers and her remonstrances had
been powerless of late to make him swerve. But
now, when she was gone, the hollow mockery of what
power remained stood revealed to him plainly; and
the Rest that was so near is not unlikely to have been
the boon he most desired. It came to him upon his
fatal day, his anniversary of still recurring success and
happy fortune; came, as is well known, on September
3rd, 1658. The Destinies had nothing better left to
give him, so they brought him death. What could be
more welcome? Very few of these who reach the
summit of ambition, as of those other who most
lamentably failed, and became bankrupt of every
hope, can feel much sadness when the messenger is
seen who comes to lead them hence,—from a world
wherein the jugglers’ tricks have all grown wearisome,
and where the tawdry pomp or glare cannot disguise
the sadness of Life’s masquerade.</p>

<h3 id="INTRODUCTION_3">§ 3.—<span class="smcap">Songs of Love and War.</span></h3>

<p>It was still 1656, of which we write (the year of
<i>Choyce Drollery</i> and <i>Parnassus Biceps</i>, of <i>Wit and
Drollery</i> and of <i>Sportive Wit</i>); not 1658: but
shadows of the coming end were to be seen. Already
it was evident that Cromwell sate not firmly on the
throne, uncrowned, indeed, but holding power of
sovereignty. His health was no longer what it had
been of old. The iron constitution was breaking up.
Yet was he only nine months older than the century.
In September his new Parliament met; if it can be
called a Parliament in any sense, restricted and coerced
alike from a free choice and from free speech,
pledged beforehand to be servile to him, and holding
a brief tenure of mock authority under his favour.
They might declare his person sacred, and prohibit
mention of Charles Stuart, whose regal title they
denounced. But few cared what was said or done by
such a knot of praters. More important was the
renewed quarrel with Spain; and all parties rejoiced
when gallant Blake and Montague fell in with eight
Spanish ships off Cadiz, captured two of them and
stranded others. There had been no love for that
rival fleet since the Invincible Armada made its boast
in 1588; but what had happened in “Bloody Mary’s”
reign, after her union with Philip, and the later cruelties
wrought under Alva against the patriots of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
Netherlands, increased the national hatred. We see
one trace of this renewed desire for naval warfare in
the appearance of the Armada Ballad, “In eighty-eight
ere I was born,” on <a href="#Page_38">page 38</a> of our <i>Choyce
Drollery</i>: the earliest copy of it we have met in print.
Some supposed connection of Spanish priestcraft
with the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 (Guido Faux and
several of the Jesuits being so accredited from the
Low Country wars), may have caused the early poem
on this subject to be placed immediately following.</p>

<p>But the chief interest of the book, for its admirers,
lay not in temporary allusions to the current politics
and gossip. Furnishing these were numerous pamphlets,
more or less venomous, circulating stealthily,
despite all watchfulness and penalties. Next year,
1657, “Killing no Murder” would come down, as if
showered from the skies; but although hundreds
wished that somebody else might act on the suggestions,
already urged before this seditious tract
appeared, not one volunteer felt called upon to immolate
himself to certain death on the instant by
standing forward as the required assassin. Cautious
thinkers held it better to bide their time, and await
the natural progress of events, allowing all the enemies
of Charles and Monarchy to quarrel and consume
each other. Probably the bulk of country farmers
and their labourers cared not one jot how things fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
out, so long as they were left without exorbitant
oppression; always excepting those who dwelt where
recently the hoof of war-horse trod, and whose fields
and villages bore still the trace of havoc. Otherwise,
the interference with the Maypole dance, and such
innocent rural sports, by the grim enemies to social
revelry, was felt to be a heavier sorrow than the
slaughter of their King.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> So long as wares were sold,
and profits gained, Town-traders held few sentiments
of favour towards either camp. It was (owing to the
parsimony of Parliament, and his continual need of
supplies to be obtained without their sanction,) the
frequency of his exactions, the ship-money, the forced
loans, and the uncertainty of ever gaining a repayment,
which had turned many hearts against King
Charles I., in his long years of difficulty, before
shouts arose of “Privilege.” But for the cost of
wasteful revels at Court, with gifts to favourites, the
expense of foreign or domestic wars, there would
have been no popular complaint against tyranny.
Citizens care little about questions of Divine Right
and Supremacy, <i>pro</i> or <i>con</i>, so long as they are left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
unfettered from growing rich, and are not called on
to disgorge the wealth they swallowed ravenously,
perhaps also dishonestly. Some remembrance of this
fact possessed the Cavaliers, even before George
Monk came to burst the city gates and chains. The
Restoration confirmed the same opinion, and the
later comedies spoke manifold contempt against time-serving
traders; who cheated gallant men of money
and land, but in requital were treated like Acteon.</p>

<p>Although, in 1656, disquiet was general, amid
contemporary records we may seek far before we
meet a franker and more manly statement of the
honest Englishman’s opinion, despising every phase
of trickery in word, deed, or visage, than the poem
found in <i>Choyce Drollery</i>, <a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>,—“The Doctor’s
Touchstone.” There were, doubtless, many whose
creed it stated rightly. A nation that could feel thus,
would not long delay to pluck the mask from sanctimonious
hypocrites, and drag “The Gang” from out
their saddle.</p>

<p>Here, too, are the love-songs of a race of Poets
who had known the glories of Whitehall before its
desecration. Here are the courtly praises of such
beauties as the Lady Elizabeth Dormer, 1st Countess
of Carnarvon, who, while she held her infant in her
arms, in 1642, was no less fascinating than she had
been in her virgin bloom. The airy trifling, dallying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
with conceits in verse, that spoke of a refinement and
graceful idlesse more than passionate warmth, gave us
these relics of such men as Thomas Carew, who died
in 1638, before the Court dissolved into a Camp.
Some of them recal the strains of dramatists, whose
only actresses had been Ladies of high birth, condescending
to adorn the Masques in palaces, winning
applause from royal hands and voices. These, moreover,
were “Songs and Sonnets” which the best musicians
had laboured skilfully to clothe anew with
melody: Poems already breathing their own music,
as they do still, when lutes and virginals are broken,
and the composer’s score has long been turned into
gun-wadding.</p>

<p>What sweetness and true pathos are found among
them, readers can study once more. The opening
poem, by Davenant, is especially beautiful, where a
Lover comforts himself with a thought of dying in
his Lady’s presence, and being mourned thereafter by
her, so that she shall deck his grave with tears, and,
loving it, must come and join him there:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing, alongside of these tender pleadings from the
worshipper of Beauty, some few pieces where the
taint of foulness now awakens our disgust, we might
feel wonder at the contrast in the same volume, and
the taste of the original collector, were not such feeling
of wonder long ago exhausted. Queen Elizabeth
sate out the performance of <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>
(if tradition is to be believed), and was not shocked
at some free expressions in that otherwise delightful
play;—words and inuendoes, let us own, which were
a little unsuited to a Virgin Queen. Again, if another
tradition be trustworthy, she herself commissioned the
comedy of <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i> to be written
and acted, in order that she might see Falstaffe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
love: but after that Eastcheap Boar’s-Head Tavern
scene, with rollicking Doll Tear-sheet, in the Second
Part of <i>Henry IV.</i>, surely her sedate Majesty might
have been prepared to look for something very different
from the proprieties of “Religious Courtship”
or the refinements of Platonic affection in the Knight,
who, having “more flesh than other men,” pleads this
as an excuse for his also having more frailty.</p>

<p>Suppose we own at once, that there is a great deal
of falsehood and mock-modesty in the talk which ever
anon meets us, the Puritanical squeamishness of each
extremely moral (undetected) Tartuffe, acting as
Aristarchus; who cannot, one might think, be quite
ignorant of what is current in the newspaper-literature
of our own time.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fact is this, people now-a-days
keep their dishes of spiced meat and their Barmecide
show-fasts separate. They sip the limpid
spring before company, and keep hidden behind a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
curtain the forbidden wine of Xeres, quietly iced, for
private drinking. Our ancestors took a taste of both
together, and without blushing. Their cup of nectar
had some “allaying Tyber” to abate “the thirst complaint.”
They did not label their books “Moral and
Theological, for the public Ken,” or “Vice, <i>sub rosa</i>,
for our locked-cabinet!” <i>Parlons d’autres choses,
Messieurs, s’il vous plâit.</i></p>

<h3 id="INTRODUCTION_4">§ 4.—<span class="smcap">On the Pastorals.</span></h3>

<p>There were good reasons for Court and country
being associated ideas, if only in contrast. Thus
Touchstone states, when drolling with Colin, as to a
Pastoral employment:—“Truly, shepherd in respect
of itself it is a good life; but in respect it is not in the
Court, it is tedious.” The large proportion of pastoral
songs and poems in <i>Choyce Drollery</i> is one other
noticeable characteristic. Even as Utopian schemes,
with dreams of an unrealized Republic where laws may
be equally administered, and cultivation given to all
highest arts or sciences, are found to be most popular
in times of discontent and tyranny, when no encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
for hope appears in what the acting
government is doing; even so, amid luxurious times,
with artificial tastes predominant, there is always a
tendency to dream of pastoral simplicity, and to sing
or paint the joys of rural life. In the voluptuous
languor of Miladi’s own <i>boudoir</i>, amid scented fumes
of pastiles and flowers, hung round with curtains
brought from Eastern palaces, Watteau, Greuze,
Boucher, and Bachelier were employed to paint
delicious panels of bare-feeted shepherdesses, herding
their flocks with ribbon-knotted crooks and bursting
bodices; while goatherd-swains, in satin breeches and
rosetted pumps, languish at their side, and tell of
tender passion through a rustic pipe. The contrast
of a wimpling brook, birds twittering on the spray,
and daintiest hint of hay-forks or of reaping-hooks,
enhanced with piquancy, no doubt, the every-day
delights of fashionable wantonness. And as it was
in such later times with courtiers of <i>La belle France</i>
surrounding Louis XV., so in the reign of either
Charles of England—the Revolution Furies crept
nearer unperceived.</p>

<p>Recurrence to Pastorals in <i>Choyce Drollery</i> is simply
in accordance with a natural tendency of baffled Cavaliers,
to look back again to all that had distinguished
the earlier days of their dead monarch, before Puritanism
had become rampant. Even Milton, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
youthful “Lycidas,” 1637, showed love for such
Idyllic transformation of actual life into a Pastoral
Eclogue. (A bitter spring of hatred against the
Church was even then allowed to pollute the clear
rill of Helicon: in him thereafter that Marah never
turned to sweetness.) Some of these Pastorals remain
undiscovered elsewhere. But there can be no
mistaking the impression left upon them by the
opening years of the seventeenth, if not more truly
the close of the sixteenth, century. Dull, plodding
critics have sneered at Pastorals, and wielded their
sledge-hammers against the Dresden-china Shepherdesses,
as though they struck down Dagon from his
pedestal. What then? Are we forbidden to enjoy,
because their taste is not consulted?——</p>

<div class="verse indent1">“Fools from their folly ’tis hopeless to stay!</div>
<div class="verse">Mules will be mules, by the law of their mulishness;</div>
<div class="verse">Then be advised, and leave fools to their foolishness,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">What from an ass can be got but a bray?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Always will there be some smiling <i>virtuosi</i>, here or
elsewhere, who can prize the unreal toys, and thank
us for retrieving from dusty oblivion a few more of
these early Pastorals. When too discordantly the
factions jar around us, and denounce every one of
moderate opinions or quiet habits, because he is unwilling
to become enslaved as a partisan, and fight
under the banner that he deems disgraced by falsehood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
and intolerance, despite its ostentatious blazon
of “Liberation” or “Equality,” it is not easy, even
for such as “the melancholy Cowley,” to escape into
his solitude without a slanderous mockery from those
who hunger for division of the spoil. Recluse philosophers
of science or of literature, men like Sir
Thomas Browne, pursue their labour unremittingly,
and keep apart from politics; but even for this abstinence
harsh measure is dealt to them by contemporaries
and posterity whom they labour to enrich.
It is well, no doubt, that we should be convinced
as to which side the truth is on, and fight for that
unto the death. Woe to the recreant who shrinks
from hazarding everything in life, and life itself, defending
what he holds to be the Right. Yet there
are times when, as in 1656, the fight has gone against
our cause, and no further gain seems promised by
waging single-handedly a warfare against the triumphant
multitude. Patience, my child, and wait
the inevitable turn of the already quivering balance!—such
is Wisdom’s counsel. Butler knew the truth
of Cavalier loyalty:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“For though out-numbered, overthrown,</div>
<div class="verse">And by the fate of war run down,</div>
<div class="verse">Their Duty never was defeated,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor from their oaths and faith retreated:</div>
<div class="verse">For Loyalty is still the same</div>
<div class="verse">Whether it lose or win the game;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
<div class="verse">True as the dial to the sun,</div>
<div class="verse">Although it be not shone upon.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Some partizans may find a paltry pleasure in dealing
stealthy stabs, or buffoons’ sarcasms, against the foes
they could not fairly conquer. Some hold a silent
dignified reserve, and give no sign of what they hope
or fear. But for another, and large class, there will
be solace in the dreams of earlier days, such as the
Poets loved to sing about a Golden Pastoral Age.
Those who best learnt to tell its beauty were men
unto whom Fortune seldom offered gifts, as though it
were she envied them for having better treasure in
their birthright of imagination. The dull, harsh, and
uncongenial time intensified their visions: even as
Hogarth’s “Distressed Poet”—amid the squalour of
his garret, with his gentle uncomplaining wife dunned
for a milk-score—revels in description of Potosi’s
mines, and, while he writes in poverty, can feign himself
possessor of uncounted riches. Such power of
self-forgetfulness was grasped by the “Time-Poets,”
of whom our little book keeps memorable record.</p>

<p>So be it, Cavaliers of 1656. Though Oliver’s
troopers and a hated Parliament are still in the
ascendant, let your thoughts find repose awhile, your
hopes regain bright colouring, remembering the
plaints of one despairing shepherd, from whom his
<i>Chloris</i> fled; or of that other, “sober and demure,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
whose mistress had herself to blame, through freedoms
being borne too far. We, also, love to seek a refuge
from the exorbitant demands of myriad-handed interference
with Church and State; so we come back
to you, as you sit awhile in peace under the aged
trees, remote from revellers and spies, “Farre in the
Forest of Arden”—O take us thither!—reading of
happy lovers in the pages of <i>Choyce Drollery</i>. Since
their latest words are of our favourite Fletcher, let our
invocation also be from him, in his own melodious
verse:—</p>

<p class="dropcap">Having found that sixty-five of our
previous pages, in the second volume
of the <i>Drolleries Reprint</i>, were filled
with songs and poems that also appear
in the <i>Antidote against Melancholy</i>,
1661; and that all the remaining songs and poems of the
<i>Antidote</i> (several being only obtainable therein) exceed
not the compass of three additional sheets, or forty-eight
pages, the Editor determined to include this valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
book. Thus in our three volumes are given four
entire works, to exemplify this particular class of
literature, the Cavalier Drolleries of the Restoration.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>To that portion of our present Appendix which is
devoted to <i>Notes to the Antidote against Melancholy</i>,
1661, we refer the reader for the admirable brief Introduction
written by John Payne Collier, Esq.; to
whose handsome Reprint of the work we owe our first
acquaintance with its pages. His knowledge of our
old literature extends over nearly a century; his opportunities
for inspecting private and public libraries
have been peculiarly great; and he has always been
most generous in communicating his knowledge to
other students, showing throughout a freedom from
jealousy and exclusiveness reminding us of the genial
Sir Walter Scott. He states:—“We have never seen
a copy of an ‘<i>Antidote against Melancholy</i>’ that was
not either imperfect, or in some places illegible from
dirt and rough usage, excepting the one we have employed:
our single exemplar is as fresh as on the day
it was issued from the press. There is an excellent
and highly finished engraving on the title-page, of
gentlemen and boors carousing; but as the repetition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of it for our purpose would cost more than double
every other expense attending our reprint, we have
necessarily omitted it. The same plate was afterwards
used for one of Brathwayte’s pieces; and we
have seen a much worn impression of it on a Drollery
near the end of the seventeenth century. It does not
at all add to our knowledge of the subject of our
reprint. J. P. C.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the copper-plate illustration is so
good, and connects so well with the Bacchanalian and
sportive character of the “<i>Antidote against Melancholy</i>,”
and other <i>Drolleries</i>, that the present Editor
not unwillingly takes up the graver to reproduce this
<a href="#frontispiece">frontispiece</a> for the adornment of the volume and the
service of subscribers. Our own Reprint and our
engraving are made from the <i>perfect</i> specimen contained
in the Thomason Collection, and dated 1661
(with “Aprill 18” in MS.; <a href="#Page_161">see p. 161</a>). We make a rule
always to go to the fountain-head for our draughts,
howsoever long and steep may be the ascent. Flowers
and rare fossils reward us as we clamber up, and in
good time other students learn to trust us, as being
pains-taking and conscientiously exact. The first
duty of one who aspires to be honoured as the Editor
of early literature is to faithfully reproduce his text,
unmutilated and undisguised. To amend it, and
elucidate it, so far as lies in his power, can be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
befittingly in his notes and comments, while he gives
his readers a representation of the original, so nearly
in <i>fac-simile</i> as is compatible with additional beauty of
typography. Throughout our labours we have held
this principle steadily in view; and, whatever nobler
work we may hereafter attempt, the same determination
must guide us. There may be debate as to
our wisdom in reproducing some questionable <i>facetiæ</i>,
but there shall be none regarding our fidelity to the
original text.</p>

<h3 id="ANTIDOTE_INGREDIENTS">§ 2. <span class="smcap">Ingredients of an “Antidote.”</span></h3>

<p>A pleasant book it appeared to Cavaliers and all
who were not quite strait-laced. It is almost unobjectionable,
except for a few ugly words, and bears
comparison honourably with “<i>Merry Drollery</i>” or
“<i>Wit and Drollery</i>,” both of the same date, 1661.
Unlike the former, it is almost uninfected with political
rancour or impurity. It is a jovial book, that roysters
and revellers loved to sing their Catches from; nay,
if some laughing nymphs did not drop their eyes
over its pages we are no conjurors. A vulgar phrase
or two did not frighten them. Lucy Hutchinson herself,
the Colonel’s Puritan wife, fires many a volley of
coarse epithets without blushing; and, indeed, the
Saintly Crew occasionally indulged in foul language as
freely as the Malignants, though it was condoned as
being theologic zeal and controversial phraseology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>In “The Ex-Ale-tation of Ale” we forgive the
verbosity, for the sake of one verse on the noted
Ballad-writer (see note in Appendix):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“For <i>ballads</i> <span class="smcap">Elderton</span> never had peer;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">How went his wit in them, with how merry a gale,</div>
<div class="verse">And with all the sails up, had he been at the Cup,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And washed his beard with a <i>pot of good ale</i>.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We find the character of the songs to be eminently
festive: almost every one could be chanted over a
cup of burnt Sack, and there was not entire forgetfulness
of eating: witness “The Cold Chyne,” on page
55 (our <a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>). The Love-making is seldom visible.
Such glimpses as we gain of Puritans (Bishop Corbet’s
Hot-headed Zealot, Cleveland’s “Rotundos rot,”) are
only suggestive of playful ridicule. The Sectaries,
being no longer dangerous, are here laughed at, not
calumniated. The odd jumble of nations brought together
in those disturbed times is seen in the crowd of
lovers around the “blith Lass of Falkland town” (<a href="#Page_133">p.
133</a>) who is constant in her love of a Scottish blue
bonnet:—“<i>If ever I have a man, blew-Cap for me!</i>”
But, sitting at ease once more, not hunted into bye-ways
or exile, and with enough of ready cash to
wipe off tavern scores, or pay for braver garments
than were lately flapping in the wind, the Cavaliers
recall the exploits of their patron-saint, “St. George
for England,” the gay wedding of Lord Broghill, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
described by Sir John Suckling in 1641, the still
noisier marriage of Arthur o’ Bradley, or that imaginary
banquet afforded to the Devil, by Ben Jonson’s
Cook Lorrell, in the Peak of Derbyshire. Early
contrasts, drawn by their own grandsires, between the
Old Courtier of Queen Elizabeth and the New Courtier
of King James, are welcomed to remembrance.
They forgive “Old Noll,” while ridiculing his image
as “The Brewer,” and they repeat the earlier Ulysses
song of the “Blacksmith,” by Dr. James Smith, if only
for its chorus, “Which no body can deny.” The
grave solemnity wherewith Dr. Wilde’s “Combat of
Cocks” was told; the light-hearted buffoonery of
“Sir Eglamore’s Fight with the Dragon;” the spluttering
grimaces of Ben Jonson’s “Welchman’s praise
of Wales;” and the sustained humour as well as enthusiasm
of Dr. Henry Edwards’s “On the Vertue of
Sack” (“Fetch me Ben Jonson’s scull,” &amp;c.), are all
crowned by the musical outburst of “The Green
Gown:”—</p>

<h3>1.—ON THE “AUTHOR” OF
<i>AN ANTIDOTE AGAINST MELANCHOLY</i>,
1661.</h3>

<p>Thanks be to the worthy bookseller, George
Thomason,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> for prudence in laying aside the “tall
copy” of this amusing book, from which we make our
transcript of text and engraving. Probably it did not
exceed two shillings, in price; (at least, we have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
that Anthony à Wood’s uncropt copy of “<i>Merry Drollery</i>,”
1661, is marked in contemporary manuscript
at “1s. 3d.,” each part). The title says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>These witty Poems, though sometime [they]</i></div>
<div class="verse indent2"><i>may seem to halt on crutches,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Yet they’l all merrily please you</i></div>
<div class="verse indent2"><i>for your charge, which not much is.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Who was the “N. D.” to whose light labours we are
indebted for the compounding of these “Witty Ballads,
jovial Songs, and merry Catches” in Pills warranted to
cure the ills of Melancholy, had not hitherto been
ascertained<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; or whether he wrote anything beside the
above couplet, and the humorous address To the
Reader, beginning,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>There’s no Purge ’gainst <span class="antiqua">Melancholy</span>,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>But with <span class="antiqua">Bacchus</span> to be jolly:</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>All else are but dreggs of Folly, &amp;c.</i> (<a href="#Page_111">p. 111.</a>)</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>As we suspected (flowing though his verse might be),
he was more of bookseller than ballad-maker. His
injunctions for us to “be wise and <i>buy</i>, not <i>borrow</i>,”
had a terribly tradesman-like sound. Yet he was right.
Book-borrowing is an evil practice; and book-lending
is not much better. Woeful chasms, in what should be
the serried ranks of our Library companions, remind
us pathetically, in too many cases (book-cases, especially,)
of some Coleridge-like “lifter” of Lambs,
who made a raid upon our borders, and carried off
plunder, sometimes an unique quarto, on other days
an irrecoverable duodecimo: With Schiller, we bewail
the departed,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>The beautiful is vanished, and returns not.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The title of “<i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>” was by
Playford and Tom D’Urfey afterwards employed, and
kept alive before the public, in many a volume from
before 1684 until 1720, if not later. Whether “N.
D.” himself were the “Mer[cury] Melancholicus”
whose name appears as printer, for the book to be
“sold in London and Westminster,” is to us not doubtful.
By April 18, 1661,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Thomason had secured his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
copy, and there need be no question that it was for
sport, and not through any fear of rigid censorship or
malicious pettifogging interference by the law, that,
instead of printer’s name, this pseudonym or nickname
was adopted.</p>

<p>We believe that the mystery shrouding the personality
of “N. D.” can be dispelled. The discovery
helps us in more ways than one, and connects the
<i>Antidote against Melancholy</i>, of 1661, in an intelligible
and legitimate manner, with much jocular literature of
later date. To us it seems clear that N. D. was no
other than <span class="smcap">[He]n[ry] [Playfor]d</span>. The triplets addressed
in 1661 To the Reader, beginning “There’s
no purge ’gainst Melancholy,” are repeated at commencement
of the 1684 edition of “<i>Wit and Mirth;
or, an Antidote to Melancholy</i>” (the third edition of
“<i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>”) where they are entitled
“The Stationer to the Reader,” and signed, not
“N. D.,” but “H. P.;” for Henry Playford, whose
name appears in full as publisher “near the Temple
Church.” Thus, the repetition or alteration of the
original title, “<i>An Antidote against Melancholy, made
up in Pills</i>,” or, as the head-line puts it, “<i>Pills to
Purge Melancholy</i>,” was, in all probability, a perfectly
business-like reproduction of what Playford had himself
originated. What relation Henry Playford was
to John Playford, the publisher of “<i>Select Ayres</i>,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
“<i>Choice Ayres</i>,” 1652, &amp;c., we are not yet certain.
Thirteen of the longest and most important poems
from the 1661 <i>Antidote</i><a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> re-appear in that of 1684,
beside four of the Catches. Indeed, the transmission
of many of these Lyrics (by the editions of 1699,
1700, 1706, 1707) to the six volume edition, superintended
by Tom D’Urfey in 1719-20, is unbroken;
though we have still to find the edition published
between 1661 and 1684.</p>

<p>But even the 1661 <i>Antidote</i> is not entitled to bear
the credit of originating the phrase: <i>Pills to purge
Melancholy</i>. So far as we know, by personal search,
this belongs to Robert Hayman, thirty years earlier.
Among his <i>Quodlibets</i>, 1628, on p. 74, we find the
following epigram:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“To one of the elders of the Sanctified Parlour of
Amsterdam.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse"><i>They would purge thine too, wert thou not foole-holy.</i>”</div>

</div>

<p>So long ago as the Editor can remember, the
words and music of “Arthur o’ Bradley’s Wedding”
rang pleasantly in his ears. The jovial rollicking
strain prepared him to feel interest in the bridal
attire of Shakespeare’s Petruchio; who, not improbably,
when about to be married unto “Kate the Curst,”
borrowed the details of costume and demeanour from
this popular hero of song. Or <i>vice versa</i>. To this
day, the <i>lilt</i> of the tune holds a fascination, and we
sometimes behold, under favourable planetary aspects,
the long procession of dancing couples who have,
during three centuries, footed the grass, the rashes, or
chalked floor, to that jig-melody, accompanied by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
bagpipes or fiddle of some rustic Crowdero. Can it
be possible? Yes, the line is headed by the venerable
Queen Elizabeth, holding up her fardingale with
tips of taper fingers, and looking preternaturally grim,
to show that dancing is a serious undertaking for a
virgin sovereign (especially when the Spanish Ambassador
watches her, with comments of wonder that the
Head of the Church can dance at all). Yet is there a
sly under-glance that tells of fun, to those who are her
Majesty’s familiars. Her “Cousin James” is not the
neatest figure as a partner (which accounts for her
having chosen Leicester instead, let alone chronology);
but we see him, close behind, with Anne of Denmark,
twirling his crooked little legs about in obedience
to the music, until his round hose swell like
hemispheres on school-maps. “Baby Charles and
Steenie,” half mockingly, follow after with the Infanta.
We did once catch a glimpse of handsome Carr and
his wicked paramour, Frances Howard, trying to join
the Terpsichorean revellers; but, beautiful as they
both were, it was felt necessary to exclude them, “for
the honour of Arthur o’ Bradley,” since they possessed
none of their own. What a gallant assemblage of
poets and dramatists covered the buckle and snapped
their fingers gleefully to the merry notes! Foremost
among them was rare Ben Jonson (unable to resist
clothing Adam Overdo in Arthur’s own mantle); and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
honest Thomas Dekker “followed after in a dream”
(as had been memorably printed on our <a href="#Page_7">seventh page</a>
of <i>Choyce Drollery</i>), thinking of Bellafront’s repentance,
and her quotation of the well-known burden,
“O brave Arthur o’ Bradley, then!” A score of poets
are junketting with merry milkmaids and Wives of
Windsor. Richard Brathwaite (the creator of Drunken
Barnaby) is not absent from among them; although
he sees, outside the circle that for a moment has
formed around a Maypole, an angry crowd of schismatic
Puritans, who are scowling at them with malignant
eyes, and denunciations misquoted from Scripture.
Many a fair Precisian, nevertheless, yields to
the honeyed pleading of a be-love-locked Cavalier, and
the irresistible charms of “Arthur o’ Bradley, ho!”
showing the prettiest pair of ankles, and the most delightful
mixture of bashfulness and enjoyment; until
the Roundhead Buff-coats prove too numerous, and
whisk her off to a conventicle, where, the sexes sitting
widely apart, for aught we know, the crop-eared rout
sing unpoetic versions of the Psalmist to the tune of
Arthur o’ Bradley, “godlified” and eke expurgated.</p>

<p>Cromwell, we know, loved music, withal, and it is
not unlikely that those two ladies are his daughters,
whom we behold dancing somewhat stiffly in John
Hingston’s music-chamber; Mrs. Claypole and her
sister, Mrs Rich: there are L’Estrange, who fiddles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to them, and Old Noll, smiling pleasantly, though the
tune be Arthur o’ Bradley. Our Second Charles (not
yet “Restored”) is also dancing to it, at the Hague
(as we see in Janssen’s Windsor picture), with the
Princess Palatine Elizabeth, and such a bevy of bright
faces round them, that we lose our heart entirely.
Can we not see him again—crowned now, and self-acknowledged
as “Old Rowley”—at one of the many
balls in Whitehall recorded by Samuel Pepys,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
gaily into all the mirth with that grave, swarthy
face of his; not noticing the pouts of Catherine, who
sits neglected while The Castlemaine laughs loudly,
the fair Stewart simpers, and the little spaniels bark
or caper through the palace, snapping at the dancers’
heels? Be sure that pretty Nelly and saucy Knipp
were also well acquainted with the music of “rare
Arthur o’ Bradley,” as indeed were thousands of the
play-goers to whom the former once sold oranges.</p>

<p>And lower ranks delighted in it. Pierce, the Bagpiper,
is himself the central figure, when we look
again, “with cheeks as big as a mitre,” such time as
that table-full of Restoration revellers (whom we catch
sight of in our <a href="#frontispiece">frontispiece</a> to the <i>Antidote</i>, 1661) are
beginning to shake a toe in honour of the music.</p>

<p>So it continues for two centuries more, with all
varieties of costume and feature. Certain are we that
plump Sir Richard Steele whistled the tune, and Dean
Swift gave the Dublin ballad-singer a couple of thirteens
for singing it. Dr. Johnson grunted an accompaniment
whenever he heard the melody, and James
Boswell insisted on dancing to it, though a little
“overtaken,” and got his sword entangled betwixt his
legs, which cost him a fall and a plastered head-piece,
by no means for the only time on record. It is reported
that good old George the Third was seen endeavouring
to persuade Queen Charlotte to accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
him on the Spinnet, while he set their numerous
olive-branches jigging it delightedly “<i>for the honour of
<span class="antiqua">Arthur</span> o’ <span class="antiqua">Bradley</span></i>.” But whenever Dr. John Wolcot
was reported to be prowling near at hand, with Peter
Pindaresque eyes, the motion ceased. Well was it
loved by honest Joseph Ritson, <i>impiger, iracundus
inexorabilis, acer</i>—better than vegetable diet and
eccentric spelling, or the flagellation of inexact antiquarian
Bishops. We ourselves may have beheld
him in high glee perusing the black-letter ballad, and
rectifying its corrupt text by the <i>Antidote against
Melancholy’s</i>. How lustily he skipped, shouting meanwhile
the burden of “<i>brave <span class="antiqua">Arthur</span> o’ <span class="antiqua">Bradley</span>!</i>” so
that unconsciously he joined the ten-mile train of
dancers. They are still winding around us, some in
a Nineteenth-Century garb (a little tattered, but it
adds to the picturesqueness), blithe Hop-pickers of
West-Bridge Deanery. There are a few New Zealanders,
we understand, waiting to join the throng,
(including Macaulay’s own particular circumnavigating
meditator, yet unborn); so that as long as the world
wags no welcome may be lacking to the mirth and
melody, jigging and joustling,</p>

near the end of the first part of his <i>Honest Whore</i>, 1604;
when Bellafront, assuming to be mad, hears that Mattheo
is to marry her, she exclaims—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">“<i>Shall he? O brave <span class="antiqua">Arthur</span> of <span class="antiqua">Bradley</span>, then?</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Ben Jonson’s <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, 1614, (which covers
the Puritans with ridicule, for the delight of James 1st.),
Act ii. Scene 1, when Adam Overdo, the Sectary, is disguised
in a “garded coat” as Arthur o’ Bradley, to
gesticulate outside a booth, Mooncalf salutes him thus:—“O
Lord! do you not know him, Mistress? <i>’tis mad
<span class="antiqua">Arthur</span> of <span class="antiqua">Bradley</span> that makes the orations</i>.—Brave
master, old Arthur of Bradley, how do you do? Welcome
to the Fair! When shall we hear you again, to
handle your matters, <i>with your back against a booth</i>, ha?”</p>

<p>In Richard Brathwaite’s <i>Strappado for the Diuell</i>, 1615,
p. 225 (in a long poem, containing notices of Wakefield,
Bradford, and Kendall, addressed “to all true-bred Northerne
Sparks, of the generous Society of the Cottoneers,”
&amp;c.) is the following reference to this tune, and to other
two, viz. “Wilson’s Delight,” and “Mal Dixon’s Round:”</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On pp. 540, 604, of William Chappell’s excellent work,
<i>The Popular Music of the Olden Time</i>, are given two
tunes, one for the <i>Antidote</i> version, and the other for
the modern, as sung by Taylor, “Come neighbours, and
listen a while.” He quotes the two lines from Gayton,
and also this from Wm. Wycherley’s <i>Gentleman Dancing
Master</i>, 1673, Act i, Sc. 2, where Gerrard says:—“Sing
him ‘<i>Arthur of Bradley</i>,’ or ‘<i>I am the Duke of
Norfolk</i>.’”</p>

<p>It is quite evident, from such passages, that during a
long time a proverbial and popular character attached to
this noisy personage: such has not yet passed away. The
earliest complete imprint of “Arthur o’ Bradley” as a
Song, (from a printed original, of 1656, beginning “<i>All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
you that desire to merry be</i>,”) in our present <a href="#ARTHUR"><span class="smcap">Appendix</span>,
Part iv</a>. Quite distinct from this hitherto unnoticed examplar,
not already reprinted, is “<i>Saw you not <span class="antiqua">Pierce</span>,
the piper</i>,” &amp;c., the ballad reproduced by us, from
<i>Merry Drollery</i>, 1661, Part 2nd., p. 124, (and ditto,
<i>Compleat</i> 1670, 1691, p. 312); which agrees with the
<i>Antidote against Melancholy</i>, same date, 1661, p. 16.
More than a Century later, an inferior rendering was common,
printed on broadsheets. It was mentioned, in 1797,
by Joseph Ritson, as being a “much more modern ballad
[than the <i>Antidote</i> version] upon this popular subject, in
the same measure intitled <i>Arthur o’ Bradley</i>, and beginning
‘All in the merry month of May.’” (<i>Robin Hood</i>,
1797, ii. 211.) Of this we already gave two verses, (in
Appendix to <i>M. Drollery C.</i>, p. 400), but as we believe
the ballad has not been reprinted in this century, we may
give all that is extant, from the only copy within reach,
of <span class="smcap">Arthur o’ Bradley</span>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>All in the merry month of May,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The maids [they will be gay,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>For] a May-pole they will have, &amp;c.</i>”</div>
<div class="attr">(<a href="#ARTHUR">See the present Appendix, Part iv.</a>)</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this, doubtless, we detect two versions, garbed together.
What is now the final verse is merely a variation
of the sixth: probably the broadsheet-printer could not
meet with a genuine eighth verse. Robert Bell denounced
the whole as “a miserable composition” (even as he had
declared against the amatory Lyrics of Charles the
Second’s time): but then, he might have added, with
Goldsmith, “My Bear dances to none but the werry
genteelest of tunes.”</p>

<p>Far superior to this was the “Arthur o’ Bradley’s
Wedding:</p>

<p>“<i>Come, neighbours, and listen awhile,
If ever you wished to smile</i>,” &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
which was sung by ... Taylor, a comic actor, about the
beginning of this century. It is not improbable that he
wrote or adapted it, availing himself of such traditional
scraps as he could meet with. Two copies of it, duplicate,
on broadsheets, are in the Douce Collection at Oxford,
vol. iv. pp. 18, 19. A copy, also, in J. H. Dixon’s <i>Bds. and
Sgs. of the Peasantry</i>, Percy Soc., 1845, vol. xvii. (and in
R. B.’s <i>Annotated Ed. B. P.</i>, p. 138.)</p>

<p>There is still another “Arthur o’ Bradley,” but not
much can, or need, be said in its favour; except that it
contains only three verses. Yet even these are more
than two which can be spared. Its only tolerable lines
are borrowed from the Roxburghe Ballad. It is the <i>nadir</i>
of Bradleyism, and has not even a title, beyond the burden
“<i>O rare <span class="antiqua">Arthur</span> o’ <span class="antiqua">Bradley</span>, O!</i>” Let us, briefly, be in
at the death: although Arthur makes not a Swan-like
end, with the help of his Catnach poet. It begins thus:</p>

<div class="verse"><i>’Twas in the sweet month of May, I walked out to take the air,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>My Father he died one day, and he left me his son and heir;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>He left me a good warm house, that wanted only a thatch,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>A strong oak door to my chamber, that only wanted a latch;</i></div>

</div>

“And will he not come again?”</p>

very low.” With other four, commencing respectively on pp. 146,
153, 161, and 168, it is degraded from position here; for substantial
reasons; and (with a few others, afterwards to be specified,)
given separately. Nothing but the absolute necessity of making
this a genuine Antiquarian Reprint, worthy of the confidence of
all mature students of our Early Literature, compels the Editor to
admit such prurient and imbecile pieces at all. They are tokens
of a debased taste that would be inconceivable, did we not remember
that, not more than twenty years ago, crowds of MP.s,
Lawyers, and Baronets listened with applause, and encored tumultuously,
songs far more objectionable than these (if possible)
in London Music Halls, and Supper Rooms. Those who recollect
what R...s sang (such as “The Lock of Hair,” “My name
it is Sam Hall, Chimbley Sweep,” &amp;c.), and what “Judge N——”
said at his Jury Court, need not be astonished at anything which
was sung or written in the days of the Commonwealth and at the
Restoration. A few words we suppress into dots in <i>Supplement</i>, &amp;c.]</p>

<p>[Part First, 1661, ends on pages 171-175, with <i>The new Medley
of the Country man, Citizen, and Souldier</i> (which in the 1670
and 1691 editions are on pp. 182-187). The 1661 edition of
<span class="smcap">Second Part</span> has a complete title-page of its own, in black and
red, exactly agreeing with its own First Part, except that the
words are prefixed “<span class="smcap">The</span> || Second Part || <span class="smcap">of</span>.” A contemporary
MS. note in Ant. à Wood’s copy, says, of each part, “1s. 3d.” as
the original price. There is also, in the 1661 edition (and in that
only), another address, here, which runs as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote larger">

<p class="center">“To the Reader:</p>

<p class="noindent">“Courteous Reader,</p>

<p>“<i>We do here present thee with the
Second part of <span class="antiqua">Merry Drollery</span>,
not doubting but it will find good Reception
with the more Ingenious; The deficiency of

shall serve: In the mean time</i></p>

<p class="right">Farewel.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Third Part</i>, mentioned above, never appeared.</p>

<p>The woodcut Initial W represents Salome, the daughter of Herodias,
receiving from the Roman-like <i>Stratiotes</i> the head of John the
Baptist (whose body lies at their feet), she holding her charger.
The Editor hopes to engrave it for the <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a> to this present
volume.</p>

the three other pieces which are to be found in succession, already
printed in our <i>Merry Drollery, Compleat</i> of 1670, 1691, pp. 296-301:

In the former edition it is followed by “The Answer,” beginning

<p>Readers, who have accompanied the Editor
both in text and comment throughout these
three volumes of Reprints from the <i>Drolleries of the
Restoration</i>, can scarcely have failed to see that he has
desired to present the work for their study with such
advantages as lay within his reach. Certainly, he
never could have desired to assist in bringing these
rare volumes into the hands of a fresh generation, if
he believed not that their few faults were far outweighed
by their merits; and that much may be learnt
from both of these. Every antiquary is well aware
that during the troubled days of the Civil War, and
for the remaining years of the seventeenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
books were printed with such an abundance of typographical
errors that a pure text of any author cannot
easily be recovered. In the case of all unlicensed
publications, such as anonymous pamphlets, <i>facetiæ</i>,
broad-sheet Ballads, and the more portable <i>Drolleries</i>,
these imperfections were innumerable. Dropt
lines and omitted verses, corrupt readings and perversions
of meaning, sometimes amounting to a total destruction
of intelligibility, might drive an Editor to
despair.</p>

<p>In regard to the <i>Drolleries</i>-literature, especially, if
we remember, as we ought to do, the difficulties and
dangers attendant on the printing of these political
squibs and pasquinades, we shall be less inclined to
rail at the original collector, or “author,” and printers.
If we ourselves, as Editor, do our best to examine
such other printed books and manuscripts of the time,
as may assist in restoring what for awhile was corrupted
or lost from the text (<i>keeping these corrections
and additions clearly distinguished, within square brackets,
or in Appendix Notes</i> to each successive volume),
we shall find ourselves more usefully employed than in
flinging stones at the Cavaliers of the Restoration, because
they left behind them many a doubtful reading
or an empty flaggon.</p>

<p>We have given back, to all who desire to study these
invaluable records of a memorable time, four complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
unmutilated works (except twenty-seven necessarily
dotted words): and we could gladly have furnished
additional information regarding each and all of these,
if further delay or increased bulk had not been equally
inexpedient.</p>

<p>1.—In <i>Choyce Drollery</i>, 1656, are seen such fugitive
pieces of poetry as belong chiefly to the reign of
Charles 1st., and to the eight years after he had been
judicially murdered.</p>

<p>2.—In <i>Merry Drollery</i>, 1661, and in the <i>Antidote
against Melancholy</i> of the same date, we receive an
abundant supply of such Cavalier songs, ballads, lampoons
or pasquinades, social and political, as may
serve to bring before us a clear knowledge of what was
being thought, said, and done during the first year of
the Restoration; and, indeed, a reflection of much that
had gone recently before, as a preparation for it.</p>

<p>3.—In such <i>additional</i> matter as came to view in
the <i>Merry Drollery, Compleat</i>, of 1670 (N.B., precisely
the same work as what we have reprinted, from the
1691 edition, in our second volume); and still more
in the delightful <i>Westminster-Drolleries</i> of 1671, 1672,
and 1674, we enjoy the humours of the Cavaliers at a
later date: Songs from theatres as well as those in
favour at Court, and more than a few choice pastorals
and ditties of much earlier date, lend variety to the
collection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>We could easily have added another volume; but
enough has surely been done in this series to show
how rich are the materials. Let us increase the value
of all, before entering in detail on our third series
of Appendix Notes, by giving entirely the deeply-interesting
Address to the Reader, written and published
in 1656 (exactly contemporary with our <i>Choyce Drollery</i>),
by Abraham Wright, for his rare collection of
University Poems, known as “<i>Parnassus Biceps</i>.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is “An Epistle in the behalfe of those now doubly-secluded
and sequestered Members, by one who himselfe
is none.”</p>

<p class="right">[Sheet sig. A 2.]</p>

<p class="center">“To the Ingenuous<br />
READER.</p>

<p class="noindent">SIR,</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">These leaves present you with some few
drops of that Ocean of Wit, which flowed
from those two brests of this Nation, the
<i>Universities</i>; and doth now (the sluces
being puld up) overflow the whole Land:
or rather like those Springs of Paradice,
doth water and enrich the whole world; whilst the Fountains
themselues are dryed up, and that Twin-Paradise
become desart. For then were these Verses Composed,
when <i>Oxford</i> and <i>Camebridge</i> were Universities, and a
Colledge [A 2, <i>reverso</i>] more learned then a Town-Hall,
when the Buttery and Kitchin could speak Latine,
though not Preach; and the very irrational Turnspits
had so much knowing modesty, as not to dare to come
into a Chappel, or to mount any Pulpits but their own.
Then were these Poems writ, when peace and plenty were
the best Patriots and Mæcenasses to great Wits; when
we could sit and make Verses under our own Figtrees,
and be inspired from the juice of our own Vines: then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
when it was held no sin for the same man to be both a
Poet, and a Prophet; and to draw predictions no lesse
from his Verse then his Text. Thus you shall meet here
St. <i>Pauls</i> Rapture in a Poem, and the fancy as high and
as clear as the third Heaven, into which [A. 3] that
Apostle was caught up: and this not onely in the ravishing
expressions and extasies of amorous Composures and
Love Songs; but in the more grave Dorick strains of
sollid Divinity: Anthems that might have become <i>Davids</i>
Harpe, and <i>Asaphs</i> Quire, to be sung, as they were made,
with the Spirit of that chief Musitian. Againe, In this
small Glasse you may behold your owne face, fit your own
humors, however wound up and tuned; whether to the
sad note, and melancholy look of a disconsolate Elegy, or
those more sprightly jovial Aires of an Epithalamium, or
Epinichion. Further, would you see a Mistresse of any
age, or face, in her created, or uncreated complexion:
this mirrour presents you with more shapes then a Conjurers
[<i>verso</i>] Glasse, or a Limner’s Pencil. It will also
teach you how to court that Mistresse, when her very
washings and pargettings cannot flatter her; how to raise
a beauty out of wrinkles fourscore years old, and to fall
in love even with deformity and uglinesse. From your
Mistresse it brings you to your God; and (as it were
some new Master of the Ceremonies) instructs you how
to woe, and court him likewise; but with approaches and
distances, with gestures and expressions suitable to a
Diety [Deity]; addresses clothed with such a sacred
filial horror and reverence, as may invite and embolden
the most despairing condition of the saddest gloomy Sinner;
and withall dash out of countenance the greatest
confidence of the most glorious Saint: and not with that
blasphemous familiarity [A. 4] of our new enlightened and
inspired men, who are as bold with the Majesty and glory
of that Light that is unapproachable, as with their own
<i>ignes fatui</i>; and account of the third Person in the
blessed Trinity for no more then their Fellow-Ghost;
thinking him as much bound to them for their vertiginous
blasts and whi[r]le-winds, as they to him for his own
most holy Spirit. Your Authors then of these few sheets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
are Priests, as well as Poets; who can teach you to pray
in verse, and (if there were not already too much phantasticknes
in that Trade) to Preach likewise: while they
turn Scripture-chapters into Odes, and both the Testaments
into one book of Psalmes: making <i>Parnassus</i> as
sacred as Mount <i>Olivet</i>, and the nine Muses no lesse religious
then a Cloyster of Nuns. [<i>verso</i>.] But yet for all
this I would not have thee, <i>Courteous Reader</i>, pass thy
censure upon those two Fountains of Religion and Learning,
the <i>Universities</i>, from these few small drops of wit,
as hardly as some have done upon the late <i>Assemblies</i>
three-half-penny Catechisme: as if all their publick and
private Libraries, all their morning and evening watchings,
all those pangs and throwes of their Studies, were
now at length delivered but of a Verse, and brought to
bed onely of five feet, and a Conceit. For although the
judicious modesty of these men dares not look the world
in the face with any of <i>Theorau Johns</i> Revelations, or
those glaring New-lights that have muffled the Times and
Nation with a greater confusion and darknes, then ever
benighted [A. 5] the world since the first Chaos: yet
would they please but to instruct this ignorant Age with
those exact elaborate Pieces, which might reform Philosophy
without a Civil War, and new modell even Divinity
its selfe without the ruine of either Church, or State;
probably that most prudent and learned Order of the
Church of <i>Rome</i>, the <i>Jesuite</i>, should not boast more
sollid, though more numerous Volum[e]s in this kind.
And of this truth that Order was very sensible, when it
felt the rational Divinity of one single <i>Chillingworth</i> to
be an unanswerable twelve-years-task for all their English
Colledges in Chrisendome. And therefore that
<i>Society</i> did like its selfe, when it sent us over a War instead
of an Answer, and proved us Hereticks by the
Sword: which [<i>verso</i>] in the first place was to Rout the
<i>Universities</i>, and to teach our two Fountains of Learning
better manners, then for ever heareafter to bubble and
swell against the <i>Apostolick Sea</i>. And yet I know not
whether the depth of their Politicks might not have advised
to have kept those Fountains within their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
banks, and there to have dammd them and choakd them
up with the mud of the Times, rather then to have let
those Protestant Streams run, which perchance may effect
that now by the spreading Riverets, which they could
never have done through the inclosed Spring: as it had
been a deeper State-piece and Reach in that Sanedrim,
the great Councell of the Jewish Nation, to have confined
the Apostles to <i>Jerusalem</i>, and there to have muzzeld
them [A 6] with Oaths, and Orders; rather then by a
fruitful Persecution to scatter a few Gospel Seeds, that
would spring up the Religion of the whole world: which
had it been Coopd within the walls of that City, might (for
all they knew) in few years have expired and given up
the ghost upon the same <i>Golgotha</i> with its Master. And
as then every Pair of Fishermen made a Church and
caught the sixt part of the world in their Nets; so now
every Pair of Ce[o]lledge-fellows make as many several
Universityes; which are truly so call’d, in that they are
Catholick, and spread over the face of the whole earth;
which stand amazed, to see not onely Religion, but
Learning also to come from beyond the <i>Alpes</i>; and that
a poor despised Canton and nook of the world should
contain as much of each [<i>verso</i>] as all the other Parts besides.
But then, as when our single Jesus was made an
universall Saviour, and his particular Gospel the Catholick
Religion; though that Jesus and this Gospel did
both take their rise from the holy City; yet now no City
is more unholy and infidel then that; insomuch that there
is at this day scarce any thing to be heard of a Christ at
<i>Jerusalem</i>, more then that such a one was sometimes
there, nor any thing to be seen of his Gospel, more
then a Sepulcher: just so it is here with us; where
though both Religion and Learning do owe their
growth, as well as birth, to those Nurseryes of
both, the Universityes; yet, since the Siens of those
Nurseryes have been transplanted, there’s little remaines
in them now (if they are not belyed) either of the old [A 7]
Religion and Divinity, more then its empty Chair &amp; Pulpit,
or of the antient Learning &amp; Arts, except bare
Schools, and their gilded Superscriptions: so far have we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
beggard our selves to enrich the whole world. And thus,
<i>Ingenuous Sir</i>, have I given you the State and Condition
of this <i>Poetick Miscellany</i>, as also of the <i>Authors</i>; it being
no more then some few slips of the best Florists made up
into a slender Garland, to crown them in their Pilgrimage,
and refresh thee in thine: if yet their very Pilgrimage be
not its selfe a Crown equall to that of Confessors, and
their Academicall Dissolution a Resurrection to the greatest
temporall glory: when they shall be approved of by
men and Angels for a chosen Generation, a Royal Priesthood,
a peculiar People. In the interim let this [<i>verso</i>]
comfort be held out to you, <i>our secluded University members</i>,
by him that is none; (and therefore what hath been
here spoken must not be interpreted as out of passion to
my self, but meer zeal to my Mother) that according to
the generally received Principles and Axioms of Policy,
and the soundest Judgment of the most prudential Statesmen
upon those Principles, the date of your sad Ostracisme
is expiring, and at an end; but yet such an end, as
some of you will not embrace when it shall be offered;
but will chuse rather to continue Peripateticks through the
whole world, then to return, and be so in your own Colledges.
For as that great Councell of <i>Trent</i> had a Form
and Conclusion altogether contrary to the expectation and
desires of them that procured it; so our great Councels of
<i>England</i> [A 8] (our late Parliament) will have such a result,
and Catastrophe, as shall no ways answer the Fasts
and Prayers, the Humiliations, and Thanksgivings of
their Plotters and Contrivers: such a result I say, that
will strike a palsie through Mr. <i>Pims</i> ashes, make his cold
Marble sweat; and put all those several Partyes, and
Actors, that have as yet appeard upon our tragical bloudy
Stage, to an amazed stand and gaze: when they shall
confess themselves (but too late) to be those improvident
axes and hammers in the hand of a subtle <i>Workman</i>;
whereby he was enabled to beat down, and square out
our Church and State into a Conformity with his own.
And then it will appeare that the great Worke, and the
holy Cause, and the naked Arme, so much talked of for
[<i>verso</i>] these fifteen years, were but the work, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
cause, and the arme of that <i>Hand</i>, which hath all this
while reached us over the <i>Alpes</i>; dividing, and composing,
winding us up, and letting us down, untill our very discords
have set and tuned us to such notes, both in our
Ecclesiastical, and Civill Government; as may soonest
conduce to that most necessary Catholick Unison and
Harmony, which is an essential part of Christs Church
here upon Earth, and the very Church its selfe in Heaven.
And thus far, <i>Ingenuous Reader</i>, suffer him to be a Poet
in his Prediction, though not in his Verse; who desires
to be known so far to thee, as that he is a friend to persecuted
Truth and Peace; and thy most affectionate Christian
Servant,</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_1">1.—CHOYCE DROLLERY, 1656.</h3>

<h4>Note, on <a href="#ADDRESS"><i>The Address to the Reader</i></a>, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>The subscribed initials, “R. P.” are those of Robert
Pollard; whose name appears on the title-page (which we
reproduce), preceding his address. Excepting that he
was a bookseller, dwelling and trading at the “Ben Jonson’s
Head, behind the Exchange,” in business-connection
with John Sweeting, of the Angel, in Pope’s
Head Alley, in 1656; and that he had previously issued
a somewhat similar Collection of Poems to the <i>Choyce
Drollery</i> (successful, but not yet identified), we know
nothing more of Robert Pollard. The books of that date,
and of that special class, are extremely rare, and the few
existing copies are so difficult of access (for the most part
in private possession, almost totally inaccessible except to
those who know not how to use them), that information
can only be acquired piecemeal and laboriously. Five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
years hence, if the Editor be still alive, he may be able to
tell much more concerning the authors and the compilers
of the <i>Restoration Drolleries</i>.</p>

<p>We are told that there is an extra leaf to <i>Choyce Drollery</i>,
“only found in a few copies, containing ten lines of
verse, beginning <i>Fame’s windy trump</i>, &amp;c. This leaf
occurs in one or two extant copies of <i>England’s Parnassus</i>,
1600. Many of the pieces found here are
much older than the date of the book [viz., 1656]. It
contains notices of many of our early poets, and, unlike
some of its successors, is of intrinsic value. Only two or
three copies have occurred.” (<i>W. C. H.’s Handb. Pop.
Lit. G. B.</i>, 1867, p. 168.) “Cromwell’s Government ordered
this book to be burned.” (<i>Ibid.</i>) On this last item
see our <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a>, section first. J. P. Collier, who
prepared the Catalogue of Richard Heber’s Collection,
<i>Bibliotheca Heberiana</i>, Pt. iv., 1834 (a rich storehouse for
bibliographical students, but not often gratefully acknowledged
by them), thus writes of <i>Choyce Drollery</i>:—“This
is one of the most intrinsically valuable of the <i>Drolleries</i>,
if only for the sake of the very interesting poem in which
characters are given of all the following Poets: Shakespeare,
Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Massinger, Chapman,
Daborne, Sylvester, Quarles, May, Sands, Digges,
Daniel, Drayton, Withers, Brown, Shirley, Ford, Middleton,
Heywood, Churchyard, Dekker, Brome, Chaucer,
Spencer, Basse, and finally John Shank, the Actor, who
is said to have been famous for a jig. Other pieces are
much older, and are here reprinted from previous collections”
[mostly lost]. P. 90.</p>

<p>It is also known to J. O. Halliwell-Phillips; (but, truly,
what is <i>not</i> known to him?) See <i>Shakespeare Society’s
Papers</i>, iii. 172, 1847.</p>

<p>In our copy of <i>England’s Parnassus</i> (unindexed, save
subjects), 1600, we sought to find “<i>Fame’s windy
trump</i>.” [We hear that the leaf was in <i>E. P.</i> at Tite’s
sale, 1874.]</p>

<p>As we have never seen a copy of <i>Choyce Drollery</i> containing
the passage of “ten lines,” described as beginning
“Fame’s Windy Trump,” we cannot be quite certain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the following, from <i>England’s Parnassus</i>, 1600, being the
one in question, but believe that it is so. Perhaps it ran,
“<i>Fame’s Windy Trump, whatever sound out-flies</i>,” &amp;c.
There are twenty-seven lines in all. We distinguish the
probable portion of “ten lines” by enclosing the other
two parts in brackets:—</p>

<p>This beautiful little love-poem re-appears, as Song 77,

Note thereunto, p. lxiii.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_5">Page 5.</a> <i>One night the great <span class="antiqua">Apollo</span>, pleased with <span class="antiqua">Ben</span>.</i></h4>

<p>This remarkable and little-known account of “<span class="smcap">The
Time-Poets</span>” is doubly interesting, as being a contemporary
document, full of life-like portraiture of men
whom no lapse of years can banish from us; welcome
friends, whom we grow increasingly desirous of beholding
intimately. Glad are we to give it back thus to
the world; our chief gem, in its rough Drollery-setting:
lifted once more into the light of day, from out the cobwebbed
nooks where it so long-time had lain hidden.
Our joy would have been greater, could we have restored
authoritatively the lost sixteenth-line, by any
genuine discovery among early manuscripts; or told
something conclusive about the author of the poem, who
has laid us under obligation for these vivid portraits of
John Ford, Thomas Heywood, poor old Thomas Churchyard,
and Ben’s courageous foeman, worthy of his steel,
that Thomas Dekker who “followed after in a dream.”</p>

<p>In deep humility we must confess that nothing is yet
learnt as to the authorship. Here, in the year 1656,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
almost at fore-front of <i>Choyce Drollery</i>, the very strength
of its van-guard, appeared the memorable poem.
Whether it were then and there for the first time in print,
or borrowed from some still more rare and now-lost
volume, none of us can prove. Even at this hour, a possibility
remains that our resuscitation of <i>Choyce Drollery</i>
may help to bring the unearthing of explanatory facts
from zealous students. We scarcely dare to cherish hope
of this. Certainly we may not trust to it. For Gerard
Langbaine knew the poem well, and quoted oft and
largely from it in his 1691 <i>Account of the English Dramatick
Poets</i>. But he met with it nowhere save in <i>Choyce
Drollery</i>, and writes of it continually in language that
proves how ignorant he was of whom we are to deem the
author. Yet he wrote within five-and-thirty years behind
the date of its appearance; and might easily have
learnt, from men still far from aged, who had read the
<i>Drollery</i> on its first publication, whatever they could tell
of “The Time-Poets:” if, indeed, they could tell anything.
Five years earlier, William Winstanley had
given forth his <i>Lives of the most famous English Poets</i>, in
June, 1686; but he quotes not from it, and leaves us
without an <i>Open Sesame</i>. Even Oldys could not tell; or
Thomas Hearne, who often had remembered whatever
Time forgot.</p>

<p>As to the date: we believe it was certainly written between
1620 (inclusive) and 1636; nearer the former year.</p>

<p>We reconcile ourselves for the failure, by turning to
such other and similar poetic groupings as survive. We
listen unto Richard Barnfield, when he sings sweetly his
“Remembrance of some English Poets,” in 1598. We
cling delightedly to the words of our noble Michael Drayton—whose
descriptive map of native England, <i>Polyolbion</i>,
glitters with varie-coloured light, as though it
were a mediæval missal: to whom, enditing his Epistle
to friend Henry Reynolds—“A Censure of the Poets”—the
Muses brought each bard by turn, so that the picture
might be faithful: even as William Blake, idealist and
spiritual Seer, believed of spirit-likenesses in his own experience.
And, not without deep feeling (marvelling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
meanwhile, that still the task of printing them with Editorial
care is unattempted), we peruse the folio manuscripts
of that fair-haired minstrel of the Cavaliers, George
Daniel of Beswick, while he also, in his “Vindication of
Poesie,” sings in praise of those whose earlier lays are
echoing now and always “through the corridors of
Time:”—</p>

<p>Something that we could gladly say, will come in befittingly
on after-pages of this volume, in the “Additional
Note on Sir John Suckling’s ‘Sessions of the

<p>Are we stumbling at the threshold, <i>absit omen!</i> even

wonder at the precise meaning of the statement in our

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">By whom additional? Who is the lady, thus elevated?
We see only one solution: namely, that furnished by the
conclusion of the poem. It was the <i>Faerie Queene</i> herself
whom the God lifted thus, in honour of her English
Poets, to rank as the Tenth Muse, an equal with Urania,
Clio, Euterpe, and their sisterhood. Yet something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
seems wanting, next to it; for we never reach a full-stop
until the end of the 39th (or <i>query</i>, the 40th) line; and all
the confluent nominatives lack a common verbal-action.
Our mind, it is true, accepts intelligibly the onward rush
of each and all (but later, “with equal pace each of them
softly creeps”). It may be only grammatical pedantry
which craves some such phrase, absent from the text, as—</p>

<p class="noindent">But, since a momentary rashness prompts us here to
dare so much, as to imagine the <i>hiatus</i> filled, let us suppose
that the lost sixteenth-line ran someway thus (each
reader being free to try experiments himself, with chance

<p class="noindent">The praise of <span class="smcap">Massinger</span> will not seem overstrained; although
he never affects us with the sense of supreme
genius, as does Marlowe. The recognition of <span class="smcap">George
Chapman’s</span> grandeur, and the power with which this recognition
is expressed, show how tame is the influence of
Massinger in comparison. There need be little question
that it was to Dekker’s mind and pen we owe the nobler
portion of the Virgin Martyr. Massinger, when alongside
of Marlow, Webster, and Dekker, is like Euripides
contrasted with Æschylus and Sophocles. We think of
him as a Playwright, and successful; but these others
were Poets of Apollo’s own body-guard. Drayton sings:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Daborne</span> is chiefly interesting to us from his
connection in misfortunes and dramatic labours with Massinger
and Nat Field; and as joining them in the supplication
for advance of money from Philip Henslow, while
they lay in prison. The reference to Daborne’s clerical,
as well as to his dramatic vocation, and to his having died
(in Ireland, we believe, leaving behind him sermons,)
“Amphibion by the Ministry,” confirms the general
belief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dudley Digges</span> (1612-43), born at Chilham Castle,

<p class="noindent">and his Description of Beauty, from Marino.</p>

<p>Of “Heroick <span class="smcap">Drayton</span>” we write more hereafter:
He grows dearer to us with every year. His “Dowsabell”
is on <a href="#Page_73">p. 73</a>. Was his being coupled as a “Poet-Beadle,”
in allusion to his numerous verse-epistles, showing
an acquaintance with all the worthies of his day,
even as his <i>Polyolbion</i> gives a roll-call of the men, and a
gazetteer of the England they made illustrious? For, as
shown in the <i>Apophthegmmes of Erasmus</i>, 1564, Booke
2nd, (p. 296 of the Boston Reprint,) it is “the proper
office and dutie of soche biddelles (who were called in
latin <i>Nomenclators</i>) to have perfecte knowlege and remembrance
of the names, of the surnames, and of the
titles of dignitees of all persones, to the ende that thei
maie helpe the remembraunce of their maisters in the
same when neede is.” To our day the office of an
Esquire Beddell is esteemed in Cambridge University.
But, we imagine, George Wither is styled a “Poets
Beadle” with a very different significance. It was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Bridewell-Beadles’ whip which he wielded vigorously,
in flagellation of offenders, that may have earned him the
title. See his “<i>Abuses Stript and Whipt</i>,” 1613, and turn to
the rough wood-cut of cart’s-tail punishment shown in
the frontispiece to <i>A Caueat or Warening for Common
Cursetors, vulgarly called Vagabones</i>, set forth by Thomas
Harman, Esquier for the utilitie and profit of his naturall
country, &amp;c., 1566, and later (Reprinted by E. E.
Text Soc., and in <i>O. B. Coll. Misc.</i>, i. No. 4, 1871).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Wither</span> was his own worst foe, when he descended
to satiric invective and pious verbiage. True
poet was he; as his description of the Muse in her
visit to him while imprisoned in the Marshalsea, with almost
the whole of his “Shepherd’s Hunting” and “Mistress
of Phil’arete,” prove incontestibly. He is to be
loved and pitied: although perversely he will argue as a
schismatick, always wrong-headed and in trouble, whichever
party reigns. To him, in his sectarian zeal or sermonizing
platitudes—all for our good, alas!—we can but
answer with the melancholy Jacques: “I do not desire
you to please me. I do desire you to <i>sing</i>!”</p>

<p>“Pan’s Pastoral <i>Brown</i>” is, of course, <span class="smcap">Wm. Browne</span>,
author of “Britannia’s Pastorals.” Like <span class="smcap">James Shirley</span>,
last in the group of early Dramatists, his precocious
genius is remembered in the text. Regretting that no
painted or sculptured portrait of <span class="smcap">John Forde</span> survives,
we are thankful for this striking picture of him in his
sombre meditation. We could part, willingly, with half
of our dramatic possessions since the nineteenth century
began, to recover one of the lost plays by Ford. No
writer holds us more entirely captive to the tenderness of
sorrow; no one’s hand more lightly, yet more powerfully,
stirs the affections, while admitting the sadness, than he
who gave us “The Broken Heart,” and “’Tis pity she’s
a whore.”</p>

<p>Not unhappily chosen is the epithet “The Squibbing
<span class="smcap">Middleton</span>,” for he almost always fails to impress us
fully by his great powers. He warms not, he enlightens
not, with steady glow, but gives us fireworks instead of
stars or altar-burnings. We except from this rebuke his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
“Faire Quarrel,” 1622, which shows a much firmer
grasp and purpose, fascinating us the while we read.
Perhaps, with added knowledge of him will come higher
esteem.</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Thomas Heywood</span> the portrait is complete, every
word developing a feature: his fertility, his choice of subjects,
and rubicund appearance.</p>

<p>Nor is the humourous sadness, of the figure shewn by
the aged <span class="smcap">Thomas Churchyard</span>, less touching because
it is dashed in with burlesque. “Poverty and
Poetry his Tomb doth enclose” (<i>Camden’s Remains</i>). His
writings extend from the time of Edward VI. to early in
the reign of James I. (he died in 1604); some of the
poems in <i>Tottel’s Miscellany</i>, 1557, were claimed by him,
but are not identified, and J. P. Collier thought him not
unlikely to have partly edited the work, His “Tragedie
of Shore’s Wife,” (best edit. 1698), in the <i>Mirror for Magistrates</i>,
surpasses most of his other poems; yet are there
biographical details in <i>Churchyard’s Chips</i>, 1575, that reward
our perusal. Gascoigne and several other poets
added <i>Tam Marti quàm Mercurio</i> after their names; but
Churchyard could boast thus with more truth as a Soldier.

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Thomas Dekker</span>, or Decker (about 1575-1638),
“<i>A priest in Apollo’s Temple, many yeares</i>,” with his “Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Fortunatus,” both parts of his “Honest Whore,” his
“Satiromastix,” and “Gull’s Hornbook,” &amp;c.,—which
take us back to all the mirth and squabbling of the day—we
need add no word but praise. We believe that a
valuable clue is afforded by the allusion in our text to the
pamphlet “Dekker his Dreame,” 1620, (reprinted by J.
O. Halliwell, 1860.) We may be certain that “The
Time-Poets” was not written earlier than 1620, or any
later than 1636 (or probably than 1632), and before
Jonson’s death.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_7">Page 7.</a> “<i>Rounce, Robble, Hobble, he that writ so big.</i>”</h4>

<p>In this 50th line the word “high” is evidently redundant
(probably an error in printer’s MS., not erased when the
true word “big” was added): we retain it, of course,
though in smaller type; as in similar cases of excess.
But who was “<i>Rounce, Robble, Hobble</i>?” Most certainly
it was no other than <span class="smcap">Richard Stanyhurst</span> (1547-1618),
whose varied adventures, erudition, and eccentricities of
verse combined to make him memorable. His Hexameter
translation of the <i>Æneis</i> Books i-iv, appeared in 1583;
not followed by any more during the thirty-five years
succeeding. Gabriel Harvey praised him, in his “<i>Foure
Letters</i>,” &amp;c., although Thomas Nashe, in 1592, declares
that “Master Stanyhurst (though otherwise learned)
trod a foule, lumbring, boystrous, wallowing measure in
his translation of Virgil. He had never been praised by
Gabriel [Harvey] for his labour, if therein he had not
been so famously absurd.” (<i>Strange Newes.</i>) This
<i>Æneid</i> had a limited reprint in 1839. Warton in <i>Hist.
Eng. Poetry</i> gives examples (misnaming him Robert)
but Camden says “<i>Eruditissimus ille nobilis Richardus
Stanihurstus</i>.” In his preface to Greene’s <i>Arcadia</i>, Nash
quotes Stanyhurst’s description of a Tempest:—</p>

<p class="noindent">and indicates his opinion of the poet, “as of some thrasonical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
huffe-snuffe,” indulging in “that quarrelling kind
of verse.” One more specimen, to justify our text, regarding
“he that writ so big:” in the address to the
winds, <i>Æn.</i>, Bk. i., Neptune thus rails:—</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The recent death of Stanyhurst, 1618, strengthens our
belief that <i>the Time-Poets</i> was not later than 1620-32.</p>

<p>To <span class="smcap">William Basse</span> we owe the beautiful epitaph on
Shakespeare, printed in 1633, “<i>Renowned <span class="antiqua">Spencer</span>, lye a
thought more nigh To learned <span class="antiqua">Chaucer</span></i>,” <i>etc.</i>, and at least
two songs (beside “Great Brittaine’s Sunnes-set,” 1613),
viz., the Hunter in his Career, beginning “Long ere the
Morn,” and one of the best Tom o’ Bedlam’s; probably,
“Forth from my sad and darksome cell.”</p>

<p>The name of <span class="smcap">John Shanke</span>, here suggestively famous
“for a jigg,” occurs in divers lists of players (see J. P.
C.’s <i>Annals of the Stage</i>, <i>passim</i>), he having been one of
Prince Henry’s Company in 1603. That he was also a
singer, we have this verse in proof, written in the reign of
James I. (<i>Bibliog. Acc.</i> i. 163):—</p>

<p>“Broom” is <span class="smcap">Richard Brome</span> (died 1652), whose racy
comedies have been, like Dekker’s, lately reprinted. The
insinuation that Ben Jonson had “sent him before to
sweep the way,” alludes, no doubt, to the fact of Brome
having earlier been Jonson’s servant, and learning from
his personal discourse much of dramatic art. Neither
was it meant nor accepted as an insult, when, (printed
1632,) Jonson wrote (“according to Ben’s own nature and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>

Henry Brougham and Vaux); when we see it repeated,
almost literally, in reference to Alexander Pope’s fellow-labourer

From third verse the figure “1” has unfortunately
dropt in printing. By aid of Addit. MS. No. 11,

some being gross corruptions of sense; although, as a

the transcriber, additional to those of the original printer.
It is, in the MS., entitled “A Dialogue between <i>Pyrrotrichus</i>

mention of an ancestress, who, about 1619, married this
(?) “Sir Simeon Steward.”</p>

<p>In Wm. Hickes his <i>Oxford Drollery</i>, 1671, in Part 3rd,
(“Poems made at Oxford, long since”), p. 157, this Epigram
appears, with variations. The second verse reads:
<i>But being there a little while,</i> || <i>He met with one so right</i>
|| <i>That upon the <span class="antiqua">French</span> Disease</i> || <i>It was his chance to
light.</i> The final couplet is:—<i>The <span class="antiqua">French-man’s</span> Arms are
the sign without,</i> || <i>But the <span class="antiqua">French-man’s</span> harms are
within.</i></p>

<p>Throughout the first half of the Seventeenth century
the abundance of Epigrams produced is enormous; whole
volumes of them, divided into Books, like J. Heywood’s,
being issued by poets of whom nothing else is known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
except the name, unless Anthony à Wood has fortunately
preserved some record. These have not been systematically
examined, as they deserve to be. Amid much
rubbish good things lie hid. Perhaps the Editor may
have more to say on them hereafter. Meanwhile, take

<h4><a href="#Page_20">Page 20.</a> <i>List, your Nobles, and attend.</i></h4>

<p>This was (perhaps, by <span class="smcap">John Eliot</span>,) certainly written
in anticipatory celebration of the event described, the Reception
of Queen Henrietta Maria by the citizens of London,
1625. The full title is this:—“The Author intending
to write upon the Duke of <i>Buckingham</i>, when he
went to fetch the Queen, prepared a new Ballad for the
Fidlers, as might hold them to sing between <i>Dover</i> and
<i>Callice</i>.” It is thus the poem reappears, with some variations
(beginning “<i>Now list, you Lordlings, and attend</i>, ||
<i>Unto a Ballad newly penned</i>,” &amp;c.,) among the “<i>Choyce
Poems, being Songs, Sonnets, Satyrs, and Elegies</i>. By the
Wits of both Universities, London,” &amp;c., 1661, p. 83.
This was merely the earlier edition (of June, 1658), reissued
with an irregular extra sheet at beginning. The
original title-page (two issued in 1658) was “<i>Poems or
Epigrams, Satyrs, Elegies, Songs and Sonnets, upon several
persons and occasions</i>. By no body must know
whom, to be had every body knows where, and for any
body knows what. [MS. The Author John Eliot.]
London, Printed for Henry Brome, at the <i>Gun</i> in Ivie
Lane, 1658.” It is mentioned that “These poems were
given me neer sixteen years since [therefore about 1642]
by a Friend of the Authors, with a desire they might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
printed, but I conceived the Age then too squeemish to
endure the freedom which the Author useth, and therefore
I have hitherto smothered them, but being desirous they
should not perish, and the world be deprived of so much
clean Wit and Fancy, I have adventured to expose them
to thy view; ... The Author writes not pedantically,
but like a gentleman; and if thou art a gentleman of thy
own making thou wilt not mislike it.”</p>

<p>Verse 9th. <i>Gondomar</i> was the Spanish Ambassador at
the Court of James I., to whom, with his “one word” of
“Pyrates, Pyrates, Pyrates,” we in great part owe the
slaughter of Raleigh. Of course, the date ’526, four lines
lower, is a blunder. The rash visit to Madrid was in
March, 1623.</p>

<p>Title, and verse 8th. A <i>Jack-a-Lent</i> was a stuffed puppet,
set up to be thrown at, during Lent. Perhaps it
was a substitute for a live Cock; or else the Cock-throwing
may have been a later “improvement:” See Hone’s
<i>Every Day Book</i>, for an illustrated account, i. 249. Trace
of the habit survives in our modern “Old Aunt Sally,”
by which yokels lose money at Races (although Dorset
Rectors try to abolish Country Fairs, while encouragement
is given to gambling at Chapel Bazaars with raffles for
pious purposes). In the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, Act
iii. sc. 3, Mrs. Page says to the boy, “You little <i>Jack-a-Lent</i>,
have you been true to us?” Quarles alludes to the
practice:—</p>

<p>As to the burden (since some folks are inquisitive about
the etymology of Down derry down, or Ran-dan, &amp;c.),
we may note that in a queer book, <i>The Loves of Hero

<p class="noindent">By which we may guess that the Rope-dancer’s Song, in
our text, was probably written about, or even before, 1651.
Some among us (the Editor for one) saw Madame Sacchi
in 1855 mount the rope, although she was seventy years
old, as nimbly as when the first Napoleon had been her
chief spectator. During the Commonwealth, rope-dancing
and tumbling were tolerated at the Red-Bull
Theatre, while plays were prohibited. See (Note to p.
210) our Introduction to <i>Westminster Drollery</i>, pp. xv.-xx,
and the Frontispiece reproduced from Kirkman’s
“<i>Wits</i>,” 1673, representing sundry characters from different
“Drolls,” grouped together, viz.: Falstaff and
Dame Quickly, from “the Bouncing Knight;” the
French Dancing-Master, from the Duke of Newcastle’s
“Variety,” Clause, from Beaumont and Fletcher’s “Beggar’s
Bush,” Tom Greene as Bubble the Clown uttering
“Tu Quoque” from John Cooke’s “City Gallant” (peeping
through the chief-entrance, reserved for dignitaries);
also Simpleton the Smith, and the Changeling, from two
of Robert Cox’s favourite Drolls. We add now, illustrative
of practical suppression under the Commonwealth,
a contemporary record:—</p>

<p>One such raid on the poor actors (and probably at this
very theatre, the Red Bull, St. John’s Street, Clerkenwell)
is recorded, as of 20th December, 1649:—“Some
Stage-players in St. John’s-Street were apprehended by
troopers, their clothes taken away, and themselves carried
to prison” (Whitelocke’s <i>Memorials</i>, 435, edit. 1733, cited
by J. P. C., <i>Annals</i>, ii. 118). It was a serious business,
as we see from the Ordinance of 11 Feb., 1647-8; the
demolishing of seats and boxes, the actors “to be apprehended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and openly and publicly whipt in some market
town ... to enter into recognizances with two sufficient
sureties, never to act or play any Play or Interlude any
more,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>As for the Light-skirts, so elegantly referred to in the
Song now reprinted (as far as we are aware, for the first
time), they were certainly not actresses, but courtezans
frequenting the place to ensnare visitors. Although
English women did not <i>publicly</i> perform until after the
Restoration, except on one occasion (of course, at Court
Masques and private mansions, the Queen herself and
her ladies had impersonated characters), yet so early as
8th November, 1629, some French professional actresses
vainly attempted to get a hearing at Blackfriars Theatre,
and a fortnight later at the Red Bull itself, as three
weeks afterwards at the Fortune. Evidently, they were
unsuccessful throughout. We hear a good deal about
the far-more objectionable “Ladies of Pleasure,” who
beset all places of amusement. Thomas Cranley, addressing
one such, in his <i>Amanda</i>, 1635, describes her
several alluring disguises and habits:—</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_33">Page 33.</a> <i>Oh fire, fire, fire, where?</i></h4>

<p>Despite our repugnance to mutilate a text (see Introduction
to <i>Westminster Drollery</i>, p. 6; ditto to <i>Merry Drollery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Compleat</i>, pp. 38, 39, 40; and that to our present
volume, <a href="#Footnote_5">foot-note in section third</a>), a few letters have been
necessarily suppressed in this piece of coarse humour.
Verse fourth, on p. 33, refers to Ben Jonson’s loss of
valuable manuscripts by fire, and his consequent “Execration
upon Vulcan,” before June, 1629; an event
deeply to be regretted: also to the whimsical account of
the fire on London Bridge (see <i>Merry Drollery, Compleat</i>,
pp. 87, 369, and <a href="#Page_377">Additional Note</a> in present volume, tracing
the poem to 1651, and the event to 1633).</p>

<p>An amusing poem was written, by Thomas Randolph,
on the destruction of the Mitre Tavern at Cambridge,
about 1630; it begins, “Lament, lament, you scholars
all.” (See <i>A Crew of kind London Gossips</i>, 1663, p. 72).</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_38">Page 38.</a> <i>In Eighty Eight, ere I was born.</i></h4>

<p>Also given later, in <i>Merry Drollery</i>, 1661, p. 77, and
<i>Ditto, Compleat</i>, p. 82 and 369. Compare the Harleian
MS. version, No. 791, fol. 59, given in our Appendix to
<i>Westminster Drollery</i>, p. 38, with note. The romance of
<i>the Knight of the Sun</i> is mentioned by Sir Tho. Overbury
in his <i>Characters</i>, as fascinating a Chambermaid,
and tempting her to turn lady-errant. “The book is better
known under the title of <i>The Mirror of Princely Deedes
and Knighthood</i>, wherein is shewed the worthinesse of
The Knight of the Sunne, &amp;c. It consists of nine parts,
which appear to have been published at intervals between
1585, and 1601.” (<i>Lucasta</i>, &amp;c., edit. 1864, p. 13.)</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_40">Page 40.</a> <i>And will this Wicked World</i>, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>We never met this elsewhere: it was probably written
either in 1605, or almost immediately afterwards. Among
Robert Hayman’s <i>Quodlibets</i>, 1628, in Book Second, No.

<p>Jeremiah Wells has among his <i>Poems on Several Occasions</i>,
1667, one, at p. 9, “On Gunpowder Treason,” beginning
“<i>Hence dull pretenders unto villany</i>,” which
solemnly conjures up a picture of what might have
ensued if (what even Baillie Nicol Jarvie would call) the
“awfu’ bleeze” had taken place. [The same rare volume
is interesting, as containing a Poem on the Rebuilding
of London, after the fire of 1666, p. 112, beginning
“What a Devouring Fire but t’other day!”]</p>

<p>With Charles Lamb, we have always regretted the
failure of the Gunpowder Plot. It would have been a
magnificent event, fully equal to Firmillian’s blowing up
the Cathedral of St. Nicholas, at Badajoz; and the loss
of life to all the Parliament Members would have been
a cheap price, if paid, for such a remembrance. The
worst of all is, that, having been attempted, there is no
likelihood of any subsequent repetition meeting with
better success. <i>Hinc illæ lachrymæ!</i> Faux, Vaux, or
Fawkes must have been a noble, though slightly misguided,
enthusiast; for he had intended to perish, like
Samson, with his victims. All good Protestants now admire
the Nazarite, although they bon-fire-raise poor
Guido. But then he failed in his work, while the other
slayer of Philistines attained success: which perhaps accounts
for the different apotheosis. As Lady Macbeth
puts it: “The attempt, <i>and not the deed</i>, confounds us!”</p>

daughter of Philip, Earl of Pembroke. The child

valuable, because trustworthy and graphic, record of the

<h4><a href="#Page_60">Page 60.</a> <i>I keep my horse, I keep</i>, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>This lively ditty is sung by Latrocinio in the comedy of
“The Widow,” Act iii. sc. 1, produced about 1616, and
written by <span class="smcap">John Fletcher</span>, Ben Jonson, and Thomas
Middleton. The song bears trace of Fletcher’s hand
(more, we believe, than of Jonson’s). It has a rollicking
freedom that made it a favourite. We meet it in <i>Wit’s
Interpreter</i>, 1655, p. 69; 1671, p. 175; and elsewhere.
See Dyce’s <i>Middleton</i>, iii. 383, and <i>Dodsley’s Old Plays</i>,

See <i>Percy’s Reliques</i>, vol. i. bk. 3, No. 8, 2nd edit. 1767,
for remarks on variations, amounting to a remodelling, of
this charming poem. We are glad to know that Mr.
James Russell Smith is preparing a new edition of
Michael Drayton’s voluminous works, to be included in
the <i>Library of Old Authors</i>. Drayton suppressed his
couplet poem of “Endimion and Phœbe:” <i>Ideas Latmvs</i>.
It has no date, but was cited by Lodge in 1595, and has
been reprinted by J. P. Collier; one of his handsome and
carefully printed quartos, a welcome boon.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_78">Page 78.</a> <i>On the twelfth day of <span class="antiqua">December</span>.</i></h4>

<p>This ballad, a very early example of the <i>Down down
derry</i> burden, is not yet found elsewhere. It refers to the
expedition against Scotland (then in alliance with Henry
II. of France) made by the Protector, Edward, Duke of
Somerset, in 1547, the first (not “fourth”) year of Edward
VIth’s reign. The battle was fought on the “Black
Saturday,” as it was long remembered, the tenth day of
September (not of “December,” as the ballad mis-states
it to have been). Terrible and remorseless was the
slaughter of the ill-armed Scots, after they had imprudently
abandoned their excellent hilly position, by the
well-appointed English horsemen. The prisoners taken
amounted to about fifteen hundred (“we found above
twenty of their villains to one of their gentlemen,” says
Patten), among whom was the Earl of Huntley, Lord
Chancellor of Scotland, who on the previous day had
sent a personal challenge to Somerset, asking to decide
the contest by single combat: an offer which was not
unreasonably declined, the Protector declaring that he
desired no peace but such as he might win by his sword.
“And thou, trumpet,” he told Huntley’s herald, “say to
thy master, he seemeth to lack wit to make this challenge
to me, being of such estate by the sufferance of God as to
have so weighty a charge of so precious a jewel, the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of a King’s person, and then the protection of
all his realms.” We learn that the Scots slain were tenfold
the number of the prisoners taken. This battle of
“Muskleburgh Field” (nearly the same locality as the
battle of Prestonpans, wherein Prince Charles Edward in
1745 defeated Colonel Gardiner and his English troops),
known also as of Fawside Brae, or of Pinkie, is described
with unusual precision by an eye-witness: See <i>The Expedition
into Scotland of the most worthily-fortunate Prince
Edward Duke of Somerset</i>, uncle to our most noble
Sovereign Lord the King’s Majesty Edward the VI., &amp;c.,
made in the first year of his Majesty’s most prosperous
reign, and set out by way of Diary, by W. Patten, Londoner.
First published in 1548, this was reprinted in
Dalyell’s <i>Fragments of Scottish History</i>, Edinburgh, 1798.
This old ballad is not included by Dalyell, who probably
knew not of its existence.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_81">Page 81.</a> <i>Blacke Eyes, in your dark Orbs doe lye.</i></h4>

and author of the celebrated <i>Epistolæ Ho-Elianæ</i>, 1645,
1647, 1650, and 1655. He died in November, 1666;
according to Anthony à Wood, (whose account of him in
the <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i>, iii. 744, edit. 1817, is given by
Edward Arber in his excellent <i>English Reprints</i>, vol. viii,
1869, with a welcome promise of editing the said <i>Epistolæ</i>).
This poem of “Black eyes,” &amp;c., occurs among
Howell’s poems collected by Sergeant-Major Peter
Fisher, p. 68, 1663; again re-issued (the same sheets) as
<i>Mr. Howell’s Poems upon divers Emergent Occasions</i>;
Printed by James Cottrel, and dated 1664.” It is also
found in C. F.’s “<i>Wit at a Venture; or, <span class="antiqua">Clio’s</span> Privy Garden</i>,
containing Songs and Poems on Several Occasions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Never before in Print” (which statement is incorrect,
as usual). Our text is the earliest we know in type. The
only variations, in <i>Howell’s Poems</i>, are: 1st line, <i>doth</i>
lie; 4th verse, And by <i>those spells I am</i> possest.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_83">Page 83.</a> <i>We read of Kings, and Gods, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>This is another of the charming poems by <span class="smcap">Thomas
Carew</span>, always a favourite with his own generation (few
MS. or printed Collections being without many of them),
and deserving of far more affectionate perusal in our own
time than he generally meets. It is in Addit. MS. No.
11, 811, fol. 6b., entitled there “His Love Neglected.”
Elsewhere, as “A Cruel Mistress.”</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_84">Page 84.</a> <i>What ill luck had I, Silly Maid</i>, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>Although closely resembling the Catch “<i>What Fortune
had I, poor Maid as I am</i>,” of 1661 <i>Antidote ag. Melancholy</i>,
p, 74, and <i>Merry Drollery</i> ii. 152 (equal to p. 341 of
editions 1670 and 1691), this song is virtually distinct,
and probably was the earlier version in date. One has
been evidently borrowed or adapted from the other.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_85">Page 85.</a> <i>I never did hold all that glisters</i>, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>This vigorous expression of opinion from a robust nature,
uncorrupted amid a conventionalized, treacherous, and
selfishly-cruel community, is a valuable record of the true
Cavalier “all of the olden time.” We have never met it
elsewhere. He has no half-likings, no undefined suspicions,
and admits of no paltering with the truth, or
shirking of one’s duty. As we read we behold the honest
man before us, and remember that it was such as he who
made our England what she is:—</p>

<p>Composers and arrangers of such collections as this Drollery
seem to have often chosen pieces simply for contrast.
Thus, after the manly directness of “The Doctor’s Touchstone,”

and followed by the truthful description (justifiable,
although coarsely outspoken) of “The baseness of

<h4><a href="#Page_98">Page 98.</a> <i>’Tis not how witty, nor how free.</i></h4>

<p>A year earlier, this had appeared in <i>Wit’s Interpreter</i>,
1655, p. 4 (1671, p. 108), entitled “What is most to be
liked in a Mistress.” Robt. Jamieson quotes it, from
<i>Choyce Drollery</i>, in his <i>Pop. Bds.</i>, 1806, ii. 309. We believe
it to be by the same author as the poem next following,
and regret that they remain anonymous. Both are
of a stately beauty, and recall to us those Cavalier Ladies
with whose portraits Vandyck adorned many family
mansions.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_99">Page 99.</a> <i>She’s not the fairest of her name.</i></h4>

<p>One clue, that may hereafter guide us to the authorship,
we know the lady’s name. It was <span class="smcap">Freeman</span>. This poem
also had appeared a year earlier, at least, in <i>Wit’s Interpreter</i>,
1655, p. 55 (; 1671 ed., p. 161). Also in <i>Wit and
Drollery</i>, 1661, p. 162; in <i>Oxford Drollery</i>, part ii. 1671,
p. 87; and in <i>Loyal Garland</i>, 1686, as “The Platonick
Lover” (reprinted by Percy Soc., xxix. 64). There
should be a comma in fifth line, after the word Constancy.
Various readings:—Verse 2, <i>meanest</i> wit; and <i>yet</i> a; 3,

<h4 id="BeaumontAndFletcher"><a href="#Page_100">Page 100.</a> <i>’Tis late and cold, stir up the fire.</i></h4>

<p>This Song, by <span class="smcap">John Fletcher</span>, in his <i>Lover’s Progress</i>,
Act iii. sc. 1., before 1625. The music is found in Additional
MS. No. 11,608 (written about 1656), fol. 20;
there called “Myne Ost’s Song, sung in <i>ye Mad Lover</i>
[wrong: a different play], set by Robt. Johnson.” It
re-appears in <i>Wit and Drollery</i> 1661, p. 212; in the
<i>Academy of Complements</i>, 1670, p. 175, &amp;c. It is the
Song of the Dead Host, whose return to wait upon his
guests and ask their aid to have his body laid in consecrated
ground, is so humorously described. His forewarnings
of death to Cleander are, to our mind, of thrilling
interest. These scenes were Sir Walter Scott’s favourites;
but Leigh Hunt, perversely, could see no merit in
them. We believe that the tinge of sepulchral dullness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
in Mine Host enhances the vividness of the incidents,
like the taciturnity of Don Guzman’s stony statue in
Shadwell’s “Libertine.”</p>

<p>Thus the hundred-paged volume of <i>Choyce Drollery</i>,
1656,—“Delicates served up by frugall Messes, as aiming
at thy satisfaction not saciety,”—comes to an end, with
Beaumont and Fletcher. On them remembrance loves
to rest, as the fitting representatives of that class of
courtly gentlemen, poets, wits, and scholars, who were, to
a great extent, even then, fading away from English
society. To them had been visible no phase of the Rebellion,
and they probably never conceived that it was
near. Beaumont, with his statelier reserve, and his tendency
to quiet musing, fostered “under the shade of
melancholy boughs” at Grace-Dieu, had early passed
away, honoured and lamented; a month before his friend
Shakespeare went to rest: Shakespeare, who, having
known half a century of busy life, felt contented, doubtless,
to fulfil the wish that he had long before expressed,
himself, almost prophetically:—</p>

<div class="verse"><i>Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Expire before their fashions:”—this he wished.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Fletcher survived nine years, and battled on with somewhat
of spasmodic action; at once widowed and orphaned
by the death of his close friend and work-fellow; winning
fresh triumphs, it is true, and leaving many a trace of his
bright genius like a gleam of heaven’s own light across
the sadness and corruption of an imaginary world, that
was not at all unreal in heroism or in wickedness. He
also passed away while young; a few months later than the
time when Charles the First came to the throne, suddenly
elevated by the death of his father James, bringing
abruptly to a consummation that marriage with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
French Princess which did so much to lead him and his
country into ruin. The year 1625 was the separating
date between the autumnal ripeness and the chill of fruitless
winter. A sunny glow remains on Fletcher to the
last. With him it fades, and the world that he had
known is changed.</p>

<p>We have already, in a brief Introduction, (<a href="#ANTIDOTE_INTRODUCTION">pp.
105-110</a>), explained our reason for adding
all that was necessary to complete this work; a large
portion having been anticipated in <i>Merry Drollery</i> of
the same year, 1661. In the Postscript (pp. <a href="#ANTIDOTE_POSTSCRIPT">161-165</a>),
we endeavoured to trace the authorship of the entire
collection; leaving to these following notes, and those
attached to <i>M. Drollery, Compleat</i>, the search for separate
poems or songs. Also, on pp. <a href="#Page_166">166-175</a>, we
traced the history of “Arthur o’ Bradley,” delaying
the important song of his Wedding (from an original
of the date 1656), unto <a href="#ARTHUR">Part IV. of our <i>Appendix</i></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>To no other living writer are we lovers of old literature
more deeply indebted than to the veteran John
Payne Collier, who is now far advanced in his eighty-seventh
year, and whose intellect and industry remain
vigorously employed at this great age: one proof of the
fact being his new edition of Shakespeare (each play in
a separate quarto, issued to private subscribers), begun
in January, 1875, and already the Comedies are finished,
in the third volume. Among his numerous choice reprints
of rare originals, his series of the more than
“<i>Seven Early Poetical Miscellanies</i>” was a work of greatest
value. To these, with his new “<i>Shakespeare</i>,” the
interesting “<i>Old Man’s Diary</i>,” his “<i>Bibliographical and
Critical Account of the Rarest Books in the English Language</i>,”
his “<i>Annals of the Stage</i>,” “<i>The Poetical Decameron</i>,”
his charming “<i>Book of Roxburghe Ballads</i>,”
1847, his “<i>Broadside Black-Letter-Ballads</i>,” 1868, and
other labours, no less than to his warmth of heart and
friendly encouragement by letters, the present Editor
owes many happy hours, and for them makes grateful
acknowledgment.</p>

<p>About the year 1870, J. P. Collier issued to private
subscribers his very limited and elegant Reprint, in quarto,
of “<i>An Antidote against Melancholy</i>,” 1661. This is
already nearly as unattainable as the original.</p>

<p>J. P. Collier gave no notes to his Reprint of the
“Antidote,” but, in the brief Introduction thereunto, he
mentioned that:—“This poetical tract has been selected
for our reprint on account of its rarity, the excellence of
the greater part of its contents, the high antiquity of some
of them, and from the fact that many of the ballads and
humorous pieces of versification are either not met with
elsewhere, or have been strangely corrupted in repetition
through the press. Two or three of them are used by
Shakespeare, and the word ‘incarnadine’ [<a href="#Page_148">see our p. 148</a>]
is only found in ‘Macbeth’ (A. ii., sc. 2), in Carew’s
poems, and in this tract: here we have it as the name of
a red wine; and nobody hitherto has noticed it in that
sense.</p>

<p>“When Ritson published his ‘Robin Hood’ in 1795,
he relied chiefly upon the text of the famous ballad of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
‘Arthur o’ Bradley,’ as he discovered it in the miscellany
before us [See our <i>Merry Drollery, Compleat</i>, pp. 312,
399; also, in present volume, <a href="#Page_166">p. 166</a>, and <a href="#Page_397">Additional Note</a>];
but, learned in such matters as he undoubtedly was, he
was not aware of the very early period at which ‘Arthur
o’ Bradley’ was so popular as to be quoted in one of our
Old Moralities, which may have been in existence in the
reigns of Henry VI. or Henry VII., which was acted while
Henry VIII. or Edward VI. were on the throne, and
which is contained in a manuscript bearing the date of
1579.</p>

<p>“The few known copies of ‘An Antidote against Melancholy’
are dated 1661, the year after the Restoration,
when lawless licence was allowed both to the press and in
social intercourse; and, if we permitted ourselves to mutilate
our originals, we might not have reproduced such
coarseness; but still no words will be found which, even
a century afterwards, were not sometimes used in private
conversation, and which did not even make their appearance
at full length in print. Mere words may be said to
be comparatively harmless; but when, as in the time of
Charles II, they were employed as incentives to vice and
laxity of manners, they become dangerous. The repetition
of them in our day, in a small number of reprints,
can hardly be offensive to decorum, and unquestionably
cannot be injurious to public morals. We always address
ourselves to the students of our language and habits of
life.”</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_113">Page 113 (original, p. 1).</a> <i>Not drunken, nor sober, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>Joseph Ritson gave this Bacchanalian chant in the
second volume of his “English Songs,” p. 58, 1783.
Forty-six verses, out of the seventy, had been repeated in
the “Collection of Old Ballads,” 1723-25, (which Ambrose
Philips and David Mallet may have edited,) “The Ex-Ale-tation
of Ale” is in vol. iii. p. 166. Part, if not all, must
have been in existence fully ten years before it appeared
in the “Antidote,” as we find “O Ale <i>ab alendo</i>, thou
Liquor of life!” with music by John Hilton, in his “Catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
that Catch Can,” p. 5, 1652. It is also in <i>Wit’s Merriment;
or, Lusty Drollery</i>, 1656, p. 118; eight verses only.
These are: 1. Not drunken; 2. But yet to commend it;
3. But yet, by your leave; 4. It makes a man merry; 5.
The old wife whose teeth; 6. The Ploughman, the Lab’rer;
7. The man that hath a black blous to his wife; 8.
With that my friend said, &amp;c. Still earlier, the poem had
appeared, imperfectly, in a four-paged quarto pamphlet,
dated 1642 (along with “The Battle fought between the
Norfolk Cock and the Wisbeach Cock,” see <i>M. D. C.</i>, p.
242) as by <span class="smcap">Thomas Randall</span>, i.e. <span class="smcap">Randolph</span>. Accordingly,
it has been included (34 verses only) in the 1875
edition of his Works, p. 662. We personally attach no
weight to the pamphlet’s ascription of it to Randolph,
(who died in March, 1634-5). It is far more likely to have
been the work of <span class="smcap">Samuel Rowlands</span>, in whose <i>Crew of
Kind London Gossips</i>, 1663, we meet it, p. 129-141, and
whose style it more closely resembles. Some poems duly
assigned to Randolph are in the same volume, but the
“Exaltation of Ale” is <i>not</i> thus distinguished. There
are seventy-two verses given, and the motto is <i>Tempus
edax rerum, &amp;c.</i> We have not been able to consult an
earlier edition of S. Rowland’s “<i>Crew</i>,” &amp;c., about 1650.</p>

<p>So long afterwards as 1788, we find an abbreviated
copy of the song, six verses, in Lackington’s “British
Songster,” p. 202, entitled “A Tankard of Ale.” The
first verse runs thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>Not drunk, nor yet sober, but brother to both,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent1"><i>I met with a man upon Aylesbury Vale,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>I saw in his face that he was in good case</i></div>
<div class="verse indent1"><i>To go and take part of a tankard of ale.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Omitting all sequence of narrative, the other verses are
adapted from the <i>Antidote’s</i> 21st, 19th, 10th, 26th, and
50th; concerning the hedger, beggar, widow, clerk, and
amicable conclusion over a tankard of ale. In a <i>Convivial
Songster</i>, of 1807, by Tegg, London, these six are given
with addition of another as fifth:—</p>

<div class="verse indent1"><i>When once he shakes hands with a tankard of ale.</i></div>

<p class="noindent">It had appeared in a Chap-book (circa 1794, according
to Wm. Logan; see his amusing “Pedlar’s Pack,” pp.
224-6), with other five verses inserted before the Finale.

<p class="noindent">Notice the characteristic mention of William Elderton,

<p class="noindent">William Elderton’s “New Yorkshire Song, intituled
<i>Yorke, Yorke, for my Monie</i>,” (entered at Stationers’
Hall, 16 November, 1582, and afterwards “Imprinted at
London by Richard Iones; dwelling neere Holbourne
Bridge: 1584),” has the place of honour in the Roxburghe
Collection, being the first ballad in the first
volume. It consequently takes the lead in the valuable
“Roxburghe Bds.” of the Ballad Society, 1869, so ably
edited by William Chappell, Esq., F.S.A. It also formed
the commencement of Ritson’s <i>Yorkshire Garland</i>: York,
1788. It is believed that Elderton wrote the “excellent
Ballad intituled The Constancy of Susanna” (Roxb.
Coll., i. 60; Bagford, ii. 6; Pepys, i. 33, 496). A list of
others was first given by Ritson; since, by W. C. Hazlitt,
in his <i>Handbook</i>, p. 177. Elderton’s “Lenton Stuff
ys come to the town” was reprinted by J. O. Halliwell,
for the Shakespeare Society, in 1846 (p. 105). He gives
Drayton’s allusion to Elderton in Notes to Mr. Hy.
Huth’s “79 Black-Letter Ballads,” 1870, 274 (the “Praise
of my Ladie Marquess,” by W. E., being on pp. 14-16).
Elderton had been an actor in 1552; his earliest dated
ballad is of 1559, and he had ceased to live by 1592.
Camden gives an epitaph, which corroborates our text, in
regard to the “thirst complaint” of the balladist:—</p>

<p>The fashion of disparaging the present, by praising the
customs and people of days that have passed away, is
almost as old as the Deluge, if not older. Homer speaks
of the degeneracy in his time, and aged Israel had long
earlier lamented the few and evil days to which his own
life extended, in comparison with those patriarchs who
had gone before him. Even as we know not the full value
of the Mistress or the friend whose affection had been
given unto us, until separated from them, for ever, by
estrangement or the grave, so does it seem to be with
many customs and things. Robert Browning touchingly
declares:—</p>

<p class="noindent">Modified in succeeding reigns, the ballad of “The Queen
[Elizabeth]’s Old Courtier, and A New Courtier of the
King [James]” has already known two hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
fifty years’ popularity. The earliest printed copy was
probably issued by T. Symcocke, by or after 1626. We
find it in several books about the time of the Restoration,
when parodies became frequent. It is in <i>Le Prince
d’Amour</i>, 1660, p. 161; <i>Wit and Drollery</i>, 1682 (not in
1656, 1661 edits.), p. 278, “With an old Song,” <i>&amp;c.</i>; <i>Wit
and Mirth</i>, 1684, p. 43; <i>Dryden’s Misc. Poems</i> (ed. 1716,
iv. 108); with the Music, in <i>Pills</i>, iii. 271; in <i>Philomel</i>,
130, 1744; Percy’s <i>Reliques</i>, ii. Bk. 3, No. 8, 1767; Ritson’s
<i>English Sgs.</i>, ii. 140, and Chappell’s <i>Pop. Music</i>, p.
300, to which refer for a good introduction, with extract
from Pepys Diary of 16th June, 1668. Accompanying a
Parody by T. Howard, Gent. (beginning similarly, “An
Old Song made of an old aged pate”), it meets us in the
Roxburghe Coll., iii. 72, printed for F. Coles (1646-74).</p>

<p>Among other parodies may be mentioned one entitled
“An Old Souldier of the Queen’s” (in <i>Merry Drollery,
Compleat</i>, 31, and in <i>Wit and Drollery</i>, 248, 1661);
another, “The New Souldier” (<i>Wit and Drollery</i>, 282,
1682), beginning:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse"><i>With a new Beard but lately trimmed,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>With a new love-lock neatly kemm’d,</i></div>

<div class="verse"><i>With a new doublet, French-like trimm’d;</i></div>

<div class="verse"><i>With new white bootes, without a strap</i>; &amp;c.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the same edition of <i>Wit and Drollery</i>, p. 165, is yet
another parody, headed “<i>Old Souldiers</i>,” which runs
thus (see <i>Westminster-Drollery</i>, ii. 24, 1672,):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse"><i>Of Old Souldiers the song you would hear,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And we old fiddlers have forgot who they were.</i></div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">John Cleveland had a parody on the Queen’s Courtier,
about 1648, entitled The Puritan, beginning “With face
and fashion to be known, For one of sure election.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Another, called The Tub-Preacher, is doubtfully attributed
to Samuel Butler, and begins similarly, “With face and
fashion to be known: With eyes all white, and many a
groan” (in his <i>Posthumous Works</i>, p. 44, 3rd edit., 1730).
The political parody, entitled “Saint George and the
Dragon, <i>anglicé Mercurius Poeticus</i>,” to the same tune of
“The Old Courtier,” is in the Kings Pamphlets, XVI.,
and has been reprinted by T. Wright for the Percy Soc.,
iii. 205. It bears Thomason’s date, 28 Feb., 1659-[60],
and is on the overthrow of the Rump, by General Monk.
It begins thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>News! news! here’s the occurrences and a new Mercurius,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>A dialogue between Haselrigg the baffled and Arthur the furious;</i></div>

<p class="noindent">Old songs have rarely, if ever, been modernized so successfully
as “The Queen’s Old Courtier,” of which “The
Fine Old English Gentleman” is no unworthy representative.
Popular though it was, thirty or forty years
ago, it is not easily met with now; thus we may be excused

<p>A series of eight Essays, each illustrated with a design
by R. W. Buss, was devoted to “The Old and Young
Courtier” in the <i>Penny Magazine</i> of the Society for
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, in 1842.</p>

<p>Charles Matthews used to sing (was it in “Patter
<i>versus</i> Clatter”?) an amusing version of “The Fine
Young English Gentleman,” of whom it was reported that,</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">T. R. Planché wrote a parody to the same tune, in his
“Golden Fleece,” on the “Fine Young Grecian Gentleman,”
Iason, as described by his deserted wife Medea: it
begins, “I’ll tell you a sad tale of the life I’ve been led of
late.” In Dinny Blake’s “<i>Sprig of Shillelah</i>,” p. 3, is
found “The Rale Ould Irish Gintleman,” (5 verses) beginning,
“I’ll sing you a dacent song, that was made by
a Paddy’s pate,” and ending thus:—</p>

<p class="noindent">(Or, as Wm. Hy. Murray, of Edinburgh, used to say, in
his unequalled “Old Country Squire,” “A smile for a
friend, a frown for a foe, and a full front for every one!”)</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Crimean War appeared another
parody, ridiculing the Emperor Nicholas, as “The Fine
Old Russian Gentleman” (it is in Berger’s <i>Red, White,
and Blue</i>, 467); and clever Robert B. Brough, in one of
his more bitter moods against “The Governing Classes,”
misrepresented the “Fine Old English Gentleman”
(<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 733), as splenetically as Charles Dickens did in
<i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, chapter 47.</p>

<p>Along with the music in <i>Pills to p. Mel.</i>, iii. 116, 1719,
are the extra verses (also in <i>Wit and Mirth</i>, 1684, p. 29?)
agreeing with the <i>Antidote</i>; as does the version in <i>Old
Bds.</i>, i. 24, 1723.</p>

<p>Another old ballad, in the last-named collection, p.
153, is upon “King Edward and Jane Shore; in Imitation,
and to the Tune of, St. <i>George</i> and the <i>Dragon</i>.”
It begins (in better version):—</p>

<div class="verse"><i>Why should we boast of <span class="antiqua">Lais</span> and her knights,</i></div>

<p class="noindent">Roxb. Coll., iii. 258, printed in 1671. Also in <i>Pills</i>, with
music, iv. 272. The authorship of it is ascribed to
<span class="smcap">Samuel Butler</span>, in the volume assuming to be his
“Posthumous Works” (p. iii., 3rd edition, 1730); but
this ascription is of no weight in general.</p>

<p>In Edm. Gayton’s <i>Festivous Notes upon Don Quixot</i>,
1654, p. 231, we read:—“’Twas very proper for these
Saints to alight at the sign of St. <i>George</i>, who slew the
Dragon which was to prey upon the Virgin: The truth
of which story hath been abus’d by his own country-men,
who almost deny all the particulars of it, as I have read
in a scurrilous Epigram, very much impairing the credit

<p class="noindent">Somewhat different is the earlier version, in <i>Wit’s Recreations</i>,
1640-45. (Reprint, p. 194, which see, “To save
a maid,” &amp;c.) The Answer to it is probably Gayton’s
own.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_133">Page 133 (orig. 29).</a> <i>Come hither, thou merriest, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>Issued as a popular broadsheet, printed at London
for Thomas Lambert, probably during the lifetime of
Charles I., we find this lively ditty of “Blew Cap for
Me!” in the Roxburghe Coll., i. 20, and in the Bd. Soc.
Reprint, vol. i. pp. 74-9. Mr. Chappell mentions that the
tune thus named “is included in the various editions of
<i>The Dancing Master</i> from 1650 to 1690; and says, the
reference to ‘when our good king was in Falkland town,’
[in the <i>Antidote</i> it reads “our good <i>knight</i>,” line 13] may
supply an approximate date to the composition.” We
believe that it must certainly have been before the Scots
sold their king for the base bribe of money from the Parliamentarians,
in 1648, when “Blew caps” became hateful
to all true Cavaliers. The visit to Falkland was in
1633, so the date is narrowed in compass. From the
Black-letter ballad we gain a few corrections: <i>drowne</i>,
for dare, in 4th line; long <i>lock’d</i>, 26th line; for <i>further</i>
exercises, 28th; <i>Mistris</i> (so we should read <i>Maitresse</i>, not
<i>a metrel</i>), 29th; <i>Pe gar</i> me do love you (not “Dear”),
30th; <i>she</i> replide. The First Part ends with the Irishman.
The Second Part begins with two verses not in
the <i>Antidote</i>:—</p>

<p class="noindent">The song is also reprinted for the Percy Society, (Fairholt’s
<i>Costume</i>), xxvii. 130, as well as in Evans’ <i>O. Bds.</i>,
iii. 245. Compare John Cleavland’s “Square Cap,”—“Come
hither, <i>Apollo’s</i> bouncing girl.”</p>

<p>The tune of this is “The Shaking of the Sheets,” according
to a broadside printed for John Trundle (1605-24,
before 1628, as by that date we believe his widow’s name
would have been substituted). We find it reprinted by J.
P. Collier in his <i>Book of Roxburghe Ballads</i>, p. 172, 1847,
as “The Song of the Caps.” In an introductory note,
we gather that “This spirited and humorous song seems
to have been founded, in some of its points, upon the
‘Pleasant Dialogue or Disputation between the Cap and
the Head,’ which prose satire went through two editions,
in 1564 and 1565: (see the Bridgewater Catalogue, p.
46.) It is, however, more modern, and certainly cannot
be placed earlier than the end of the reign of Elizabeth.
It may be suspected that it underwent some changes, to
adapt it to the times, when it was afterwards reprinted;
and we finally meet with it, but in a rather corrupted
state, in a work published in 1656, called ‘Sportive Wit:
the Muses Merriment, a new Spring of Lusty Drollery,’
&amp;c.” [p. 23.] It appears, with the music, in <i>Pills</i>, iv. 157;
in Percy Society’s “Costume,” 1849, 115, with woodcuts
of several of the caps mentioned.</p>

<p>In <i>Sportive Wit</i>, 1656, p. 23, is a second verse (coming
before “The Monmouth Cap,” &amp;c.):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">This shows how a great man’s gifts are undervalued.
Christopher Sly was truly wise (yet accounted a Sot and
even a Rogue, though “the Slys are no rogues: look in
the chronicles! We came in with Richard Conqueror!”)
when, with all the wealth and luxury of the Duke at command,
he demanded nothing so much as “a pot o’ the
smallest ale.” He had good need of it.</p>

The Catch itself has always been a favourite. In a world
wherein, amid much neighbourly kindness, there is more
than a little of imposition, the sly cynicism of the verse
could not fail to please. Folks do not object to doing a
good turn, but dislike being deemed silly enough to have
been taken at a disadvantage. So we laugh at the Catch,
say something wise, and straightway let ourselves do
good-natured things again with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>With music by William Howes, in Hilton’s <i>Catch that

77. We are told that the <i>Symon</i> here addressed, regarding
his Bardolphian nose, was worthy Symon Wadloe,—“Old
<i>Sym</i>, the King of Skinkers,” or Drawers. Possibly
some jocular allusion to the same reveller animates the
choice ditty (for which see the <i>Percy Folio MS.</i>, iv. 124,
and <i>Pills</i>, iii. 143),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">We scarcely believe the ascription to be correct, and that
“Old Symon the King” originally referred to Simon
Wadloe, who kept the “Devil and St. Dunstan” Tavern,
whereat Ben Jonson and his comrades held their meetings
as The Apollo Club; for which the <i>Leges Conviviales</i>
were written. Seeing that Wadloe died in 1626, or
’27, and there being a clear trace of “Old Simon the
King” in 1575, in Laneham’s <i>Kenilworth Letter</i> (Reprinted
for Ballad Society, 1871, p. cxxxi.), the song appears
of too early a date to suit the theory. <i>Tant pis
pour les faits.</i> But consult Chappell’s <i>Pop. Mus.</i>, 263-5,
776-7.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_154">Same p. 154.</a> <i>Wilt thou be fatt? &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>In 1865 (see his <i>Bibliog. Account</i>, i. 25), J. P. Collier
drew attention to the mention of Falstaff’s name in this
Catch; also to the other <i>Shakesperiana</i>, viz., the complete
song of “Jog on, jog on the footpath way,” (<a href="#Page_156">p. 156</a>), and
the burden of “Three merry boys,” to “The Wise-men
were but Seven” (<i>M. D. C.</i>, p. 232), which is connected
with Sir Toby Belch’s joviality in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, Act ii. 3.</p>

<h4><a href="#Page_155">Page 155.</a> <i>Of all the birds that ever I see.</i></h4>

<p>With the music, in Chappell’s <i>Pop. Mus. O. T.</i>, p. 75.
This favourite of our own day dates back so early, at
least, as 1609, when it appeared in (Thomas Ravenscroft’s?)
<i>Deuteromelia; or, the Second Part of Musick’s
Melodie, &amp;c.</i>, p. 7. We therein find (what has dropped
out, to the damage of our <i>Antidote</i> version), as the final
couplet:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Sinamont and ginger, nutmegs and cloves,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And that gave me my jolly red nose.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Of course, it was the spice deserved blame, not the liquor
(as Sam Weller observed, on a similar occasion, “Somehow
it always <i>is</i> the salmon”). Those who remember
(at the Johnson in Fleet Street, or among the Harmonist
Society of Edinburgh) the suggestive lingering over the
first syllable of the word “gin-ger,” when “this song is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
well sung,” cannot willingly relinquish the half-line. It
is a genuine relic, for it also occurs in Beaumont and
Fletcher’s “Knight of the Burning Pestle,” about 1613,
Act i. sc. 3; where chirping Old Merrythought, “who
sings with never a penny in his purse,” gives it thus,
while “singing and hoiting” [i.e., skipping]:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Nose, nose, jolly red nose,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And who gave thee this jolly red nose?</i></div>

<div class="verse"><i>And they gave me this jolly red nose</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And we know, by <i>A Booke of Merrie Riddles</i>, 1630, and
1631, that it was much sung:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<h4><a href="#Page_156">Same p. 156.</a> <i>Jog on, jog on the foot path-way.</i></h4>

<p>The four earliest lines of this ditty are sung by Autolycus
the Pedlar, and “picker up of unconsidered trifles,” in
Shakespeare’s <i>Winter’s Tale</i> (about 1610), Act iv. sc.
2. Whether the latter portion of the song was also by
him (nay, more, whether he actually wrote, or merely
quoted even the four opening lines), cannot be determined.
We prefer to believe that from his hand alone came the
fragment, at least—this lively snatch of melody, with
good philosophy, such as the Ascetics reject, to their own
damage. No wrong is done in accepting the remainder

nearly a century, almost all the best songs had been

<h4>§ 1.—EXTRA SONGS IN THE
WESTMINSTER-DROLLERY, 1674.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A living Drollery!” (Shakespeare’s <i>Tempest</i>, Act iii. sc. 3.)</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Before concluding our present series, <i>The
Drolleries of the Restoration</i>, we have gladly
given in this volume the fourteen pages of Extra Songs
contained in the 1674 edition of <i>Westminster-Drollery</i>,
Part 1st. Sometimes reported as amounting to
“nearly forty” (but, perhaps, this statement referred
to the Second Part inclusive), it is satisfactory to have
joined these six to their predecessors; especially insomuch
that our readers do not, like the original purchasers,
have to pay such a heavy price as losing an
equal number of pages filled with far superior songs.
For, the 1671 Part First contained exactly 124 pages,
and the 1674 edition has precisely the same number,
neither more nor less. The omissions are not immediately
consecutive, (as are the additions, which are
gathered in one group in the final sheet, pp. 111-124.)
They were selected, with unwise discrimination,
throughout the volume. Not fourteen pages of objectionable
and relinquishable <i>facetiæ</i>; but ten songs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
from among the choicest of the poems. Our own
readers are in better case, therefore: they gain the
additions, without yielding any treasures of verse in
exchange.</p>

<p>We add a list of what are thus relinquished from the
1674 edition, noting the pages of our <i>Westm. D.</i> on which
they are to be found:—</p>

<table summary="Verses omitted from the 1674 edition">

  </tr>
</table>

<p>Thus we see that most of these were quite new when
the <i>Westminster-Drollery</i> first printed them (in four cases,
at least, before the plays had appeared as books): they
were rejected three years later for fresh novelties. But
the removal of Carew’s tender poems was a worse offence
against taste.</p>

<p>Except the odd Quakers’ Madrigall of “Wickham
Wakened” (on p. 120; our <a href="#Page_188">p. 188</a>), which is not improbably
by Joe Haynes, we believe the whole of the other five
new songs of 1674 came from one work. We are unable
at once to state the name and author of the drama in
which they occur. The five are given (severely mutilated,
in two instances) in <i>Wit at a Venture; or, <span class="antiqua">Clio’s</span> Privy-Garden</i>,
of the same date, 1674. Here, also, they form a
group, pp. 33-42; with a few others that probably belong
to the same play, viz., “Too weak are human eyes to
pry;” “Oh that I ne’er had known the power of Love;”
“Must I be silent? no, and yet forbear;” “Cease, wandering
thought, and let her brain” (this is Shirley’s, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the “Triumph of Beauty,” 1645); “How the vain world
ambitiously aspires;” “Heaven guard my fair <i>Dorinda</i>:”
and, perhaps, “Rise, golden Fame, and give thy name or
birth.” Titles are added to most of these.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_179">Page 179.</a> <i>So wretched are the sick of Love</i>, is, on p.
37 of <i>Wit at a Venture</i>, entitled Distempered Love. The
third verse is omitted.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_181">Page 181.</a> <i>To Arms! To Arms! &amp;c.</i>, on p. 39, entitled
The Souldier’s Song; 13th line reads “Where <i>we</i>
must try.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_182">Page 182.</a> <i>Beauty that it self can kill</i>, on p. 35;
reading, in 20th line, “When the fame and virtue falls ||
Careless courage,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_183">Page 183.</a> <i>The young, the fair, &amp;c.</i>, on p. 33, is entitled
<i>The Murdered Enemy</i>; reading <i>Clarissa</i> for <i>Camilla</i>;
and giving lines 17th and 19th, “Her beauties”
and “Fierce Lions,” &amp;c. Line 23rd is “And not to
check it in the least.”</p>

<h5><a href="#Page_184">Page 184.</a> <i>How frailty makes us to our wrong.</i></h5>

<p>Called A Moral Song in <i>Wit at a Venture</i>, p. 41, which
rightly reads “grovel,” not “gravel,” in line 6; but
omits third verse, and all the Chorus.</p>

<h5><a href="#Page_188">Page 188.</a> <i>The Quaker and his Brats.</i></h5>

<p>We have not seen this elsewhere. Attributed to “the

<h5>Part II., p. 74 (App. p. lv.) <i>As <span class="antiqua">Moss</span> caught his Mare.</i></h5>

<p>Not having had space at command, when giving a short
Addit. Note on p. 408 of <i>M. D. C.</i>, we now add a nursery
rhyme (we should gladly have given another, which mentions
catching the mare “Napping up a tree”). Perhaps
the following may be the song reported as being sung in
South Devon:—</p>

<div class="verse"><i><span class="antiqua">Moss</span> was a little man, and a little mare did buy,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>For kicking and for sprawling none her could come nigh;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>She could trot, she could amble, and could canter here and there,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>But one night she strayed away—so <span class="antiqua">Moss</span> lost his Mare.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i><span class="antiqua">Moss</span> got up next morning to catch her fast asleep,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And round about the frosty fields so nimbly he did creep.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Dead in a ditch he found her, and glad to find her there,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>So I’ll tell you by and bye, how <span class="antiqua">Moss</span> caught his mare.</i></div>

<div class="verse"><i>He put the halter round her neck—so <span class="antiqua">Moss</span> caught his mare.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">As that prematurely wise young sceptic Paul Dombey
declared, when a modern-antique Legend was proffered
to him, “I don’t believe that story!” It is frightfully
devoid of <i>ærugo</i>, even of <i>æruca</i>. It may do for South
Devon, and for Aylesbury farmers over their “beer and
bacca,” but not for us. The true Mosse found his genuine
mare veritably “napping” (not dead), up a real tree.</p>

<p>In John Taylor’s “<i>A Swarme of Sectaries and Schismatiqves</i>,”
1641, his motto is (concerning Sam Howe

<h5>Part II., page 89. <i>Cheer up, my mates, &amp;c.</i></h5>

<p>(See Appendix to <i>Westm. Droll</i>., p. lxii.) The author of
this frollicsome ditty was no other than <span class="smcap">Abraham Cowley</span>
(1618-67), dear to all who know his choice “Essays
in Prose and Verse,” his unlaboured letters, the best of his
smaller poems, or the story of his stainless life and gentleness.
It is that noble thinker and poet, Walter Savage
Landor, who writes, and in his finest mood:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent7"><i>Time has been</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>When <span class="antiqua">Cowley</span> shone near <span class="antiqua">Milton</span>, nay, above!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>An age roll’d on before a keener sight</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Could separate and see them far apart.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="attr">(<i>Hellenics</i>, edit. 1859, p. 258.)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Yet while we yield unquestioningly the higher rank as
Poet to John Milton, we hold the generous nature of
his rival, Cowley, in more loving regard. He was not of
the massive build in mind, or stern unflinching resolution
needed for such times as those wherein his lot was cast.
When the weakest goes to the wall, amid universal disturbance
and selfish warring for supremacy, his was not
the strong arm to beat back encroachment. Gentle,
affectionate, and truthful, exceptionally pure and single-minded,
although living as Queen Henrietta’s secretary
in her French Court, where impurity of thought and
lightness of conduct were scarcely visited with censure,
the uncongenial scenes and company around him help to
enhance the charm of his mild disposition. Heartless
wits might lampoon him, stealthy foes defame him, lest he
should gain one favour or reward that they were hankering
after. To us he remains the lover of the “Old Patrician
trees,” the friend of Crashaw and of Evelyn, the
writer of the most delightful essays and familiar letters:
alas! too few.</p>

<p>The “Song” in <i>Westminster-Drollery</i>, ii. 89, set by
Pelham Humphrey, is the opening verse of Cowley’s
“<span class="smcap">Ode</span>: Sitting and Drinking in the Chair made out of
the Reliques of Sir Francis Drake’s Ship.” [The chair
was presented to the University Library, Oxford.]</p>

<p>Corrections: <i>dull men</i> are those <i>who</i> tarry; and spy
<i>too</i>. Three verses follow. Of these we add the earliest,
leaving uncopied the others, of 21 and 18 lines. They
are to be found on p. 9 of Cowley’s “Verses written on
Several Occasions,” folio ed., 1668. The idea of the
shipwreck “in the wide Sea of Drink” had been early
welcomed by him, and treated largely, Feb. 1638-9, in his
<i>Naufragium Joculare</i>.</p>

i. 535, printed for J. Wright, junior, dwelling at
the upper end of the Old Bailey. It begins “Now <i>Pan</i>
leaves piping,” and is in two parts, each containing five
verses. Three of these are not represented in the <i>Antidote</i>
of 1661. Wm. Chappell, the safest of all guides in
such matters, notes that “the publisher [of the broadside]
flourished in and after 1635. No clue remains to the
authorship.” (<i>Bd. Soc.</i> reprint, iii. 311, 1875.)</p>

<p>As in the case of the companion-ditty, “Come, Lasses
and Lads” (<i>Westm. Droll.</i>, ii. 80), we may feel satisfied
that this lively song was written before the year 1642.
No hint of the Puritanic suppression of Maypoles can be
discerned in either of them. Such sports were soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
afterwards prohibited, and if ballads celebrating their
past delights had then been newly written, the author
must have yielded to the temptation to gird at the hypocrites
and despots who desolated each village green. We
cannot regard the <i>Roxburghe Ballad</i> as being superior to
the <i>Antidote</i> version: But they mutually help one another
in corrections. We note the chief: first verse, So lively <i>it</i>
passes; <i>Good lack</i>, what paines; 2, <i>Thus</i> they so much;
3 (our 4), Came very <i>lazily</i>. It is after the five verses
that differences are greatest. Our 6th verse is absent,
and our 7th appears as the 8th; with new 6th, 7th,
9th, and 10th, which we here give, but print them to
match our others:</p>

<p>Collections of Songs, depending chiefly on
the popularity of such as are already in vogue,
or of others that promise fairly to please the reader,
are necessarily of all books the most liable to receive
alterations when re-issued. Thus we ourselves possess
half-a-dozen editions of <i>the Roundelay</i>, and also of the
<i>Bullfinch</i>, both undated eighteenth-century songsters;
each copy containing a dozen or more of Songs not to be
found in the others. Our <i>Merry Drollery</i> is a case in
point. As already mentioned, there is absolutely no
difference between the edition of 1670 and 1691 of
<i>Merry Drollery, Compleat</i>, except the title-page. It
was a well-understood trade stratagem, to re-issue the
unsold sheets, those of 1670, with a freshly-dated title-page,
as in 1691; so to catch the seekers after novelty
by their most tempting lure. Even the two pages of
“List of New Books” (reprinted conscientiously by
ourselves in <i>M. D., C.</i>, pp. 358, 359) are identical in
both!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>We take credit beforehand for the readers’ satisfaction
at our providing such a <i>Table of First Lines</i>, as we
hereafter give, that may enable him easily and convincedly
to understand the alterations made from the
1661 edition of <i>Merry Drollery</i>, both parts, when it
was re-issued in a single volume, paged consecutively,
in 1670 and 1691. It is more difficult to understand
<i>why</i> the changes were made, than thus to see what
they were. 1. It could not have been from modesty:
although some objectionable pieces were omitted,
others, quite as open to censure, were newly admitted
instead. 2. Scarcely could it have been that as
political satires they were out of date (except in the
case of the Triumph over The Gang—England’s Woe—and
Admiral Dean’s Funeral: our pp. <a href="#Page_198">198</a>, <a href="#Page_218">218</a>,
<a href="#Page_206">206</a>); for in the later volume are found other songs
on events contemporary with these, which, being
rightly considered to be of abiding interest, were retained.
3. It was not that the songs rejected were
too common, and easily attainable; for they are almost
all of extreme rarity, and now-a-days not procurable
elsewhere. 4. It must have been a whim that ostracised
them, and accepted novelties instead! At any
rate, here they are! As in the case of the sheet from
<i>Westminster-Drollery</i>, 1674 (<a href="#Page_177">see p. 177</a>), readers possess
the Extra Songs of both early and late editions,
along with all that are common to both, and this without
confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost all of these <i>Merry Drollery</i> Extra Songs
were written before the Restoration; of a few we know
the precise date, as of 1653, 1650, 1623, &amp;c. These
are chiefly on political events, viz. the Funeral of
Admiral Dean, so blithely commented on, with forgetfulness
of the man’s courage and skill while remembering
him only as an associate of rebels; the story of
England’s Woe (certainly published before the close
of 1648), with scorn against the cant of Prynne and
Burton; the noisy, insensate revel of the song on the
Goldsmith’s Committee (1647, <a href="#Page_237">p. 237</a>), where we can
see in the singers such unruly cavaliers as those who
brought discredit and ruin; as also in the coarser
“Letany” (on our <a href="#Page_241">page 241</a>); and in the still earlier
description of New England (before 1643), which
forms a most important addition to the already rich
material gathered from these contemporary records,
shewing the views entertained of the nonconforming
and irreconcileable zealots who held close connection
with the discontented Dutchmen. Although caricatured
and maliciously derisive, it is impossible to
doubt that we have here a group of portraits sufficiently
life-like to satisfy those who beheld the originals.
As to the miscellaneous pieces, the Sham-Tinker,
who comes to “Clout the Cauldron,” has
genuine mirth to redeem the naughtiness. Dr. Corbet’s(?)
“Merrie Journey into France” is crammed
full of pleasantry, and while giving a record of sights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
that met the traveller, enlivens it with airy gaiety
that makes us willing companions. This, with variations,
may be met with elsewhere in print; but not so
the delightfully sportive invitation of The Insatiate
Lover to his Sweetheart, “Come hither, my own
Sweet Duck” (<a href="#Page_247">p. 247</a>). To us it appears among the
best of these thirty-five additions: musical and fervent,
without coarseness, the song of an ardent lover,
who fears nothing, and is ripe for any adventure that
war may offer. One of Rupert’s reckless Cavaliers
may have sung this to his Mistress. Of course it
would be unfair to blame him for not being awake to
the higher beauty of such a sentiment as Montrose
felt and inspired:—</p>

<p><i>C’est magnifique! mais ce n’est pas—L’amour.</i> At

the earlier sort of Precisian, ridiculous but not yet dangerous,
is by Richard Brathwaite, and was printed in
1615:—</p>

<p>The sixth line offers another illustration of what has been
ably demonstrated by J. O. Halliwell, commenting on
the “<i>too-too</i> solid flesh” of <i>Hamlet</i>, Act i. sc. 2, in Shakespeare
Soc. Papers, i. 39-43, 1844.</p>

<p>By it being printed within double quotational commas,
we see that the reference to a Puritan hanging his cat on
a Monday, for having profanely caught a mouse on the
Sabbath-Sunday, was already an old and familiar joke
in 1615. James Hogg garbled a ballad in his <i>Jacobite
Relics</i>, 1819, i. 37, as “<i>There was a <span class="antiqua">Cameronian</span> Cat,
Was hunting for a prey</i>,” &amp;c., but we have a printed copy
of it, dated 1749, beginning “<i>A <span class="antiqua">Presbyterian</span> Cat sat
watching of her prey</i>.” Also, in a poem “On Lute-strings,
Cat-eaten,” we read:—</p>

<p>Fairfax had returned to his house, and to Monk were
given the thanks of the rescued Parliament. As M. de
Bordeaux writes of him to Card. Mazarin, at this exact
date, “he is now the most powerful subject in the whole
nation. Fleetwood, Desborough, and all the others of
the same faction are entirely out of employment” (Guizot’s
<i>Monk</i>, 1851, p. 156). Although no mention or definite
allusion seems made in the ballad to Monk’s attack on
the London defences, Feb. 9th, we incline to think this
may be nearer to the true date: if it refers to the oath of
abjuration, of Feb. 4th, which was offered to Monk, as
on March 1st. “Arthur’s Court” is an allusion to Sir
Arthur Haselrig, “a rapacious, head-strong, and conceited
agitator” (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 37). Monk had not publicly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
declared himself for the King until May; but he was
seen to be opposed to the Rump by 11th Feb., when its
effigies were enthusiastically burnt. Richard Cromwell’s
abdication had been, virtually, April 22nd, 1659.</p>

<h5><a href="#Page_204">Page 32 [204].</a> <i>A young man walking all alone.</i></h5>

<p>This is another of the songs contained in the <i>Percy Folio

otherwise lost, but imperfect there, our fourth and fifth
verses being absent. We cannot accept “<i>if that I may
thy favour haue, thy bewtye to behold</i>,” as the true reading;
while we find “<i>If that thy favour I may win With
thee for to be bold</i>:” which is much more in the Lover’s
line of advance. Yet we avail ourselves of the “I am so
<i>mad</i>” in 3rd verse, because it rhymes with “maidenhead,”
in <i>M. D.</i>, though not suiting with the “honestye”
of the <i>P. F. MS.</i> The final half-verse is different.</p>

<h5><a href="#Page_206">Page 56 [206].</a> <i><span class="antiqua">Nick Culpepper</span> and <span class="antiqua">Wm. Lilly</span>.</i></h5>

<p>Also in 1662 edition of the <i>Rump</i>, i. 308; and <i>Loyal
Songs</i>, 1731, i. 192. The event referred to happened in
June, 1653, the engagement between the English and
Dutch fleets commencing on the 2nd, renewed the next
day. Six of the Dutch ships were sunk, and twelve taken,
with thirteen hundred prisoners. <i>Blake</i>, <i>Monk</i>, and <i>Dean</i>
were the English commanders, until <i>Dean</i> was killed, the
first day. Monk took the sole command on the next.
Clarendon gives an account of the battle, and says:
“<i>Dean</i>, one of the <i>English</i> Admirals, was killed by a cannon-shot
from the Rear-Admiral of the <i>Dutch</i>,” before
night parted them. “The loss of the <i>English</i> was greatest
in their General <i>Dean</i>. There was, beside him, but one
Captain, and about two hundred Common Sea-men
killed: the number of the wounded was greater; nor did
they lose one Ship, nor were they so disabled but that
they followed with the whole fleet to the coast of <i>Holland</i>,
whither the other fled; and being got into the <i>Flie</i>
and the <i>Texel</i>, the English for some time blocked them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
up in their own Harbors, taking all such Ships as came
bound for those parts.” (<i>His. Reb.</i>, B. iii. p. 487, ed. 1720.)</p>

<p>Verse 1. Nicholas Culpeper, of Spittle Fields, near
London, published his <i>New Method of Physick</i>, and
Alchemy, in 1654.</p>

<p>As to William Lilly, “the famous astrologer of those
times, who in his yearly almanacks foretold victories for
the Parliament with so much certainty as the preachers
did in their sermons,” consult his letter written to Elias
Ashmole, and the notes of Dr. Zachary Gray to Butler’s
<i>Hudibras</i>, Part ii. Canto 3. “He lived to the year 1681,
being then near eighty years of age, and published predicting
almanacks to his death.” He was one of the close
committee to consult about the King’s execution (<i>Echard</i>).
He lost much of his repute in 1652; in 1655 he was indicted
at Hickes Hall, but acquitted. He dwelt at Hersham,
Walton-on-Thames, and elsewhere. Henry Coley
followed him in almanack-making, and John Partridge
next. In the Honble. Robt. Howard’s Comedy, “The
Committee,” 1665, we find poor Teague has been consulting
Lilly:—</p>

<p>Verse 12. The Master of the Rolls. This was Sir
Dudley Digges, builder of Chilham Castle, near Canterbury,
Kent, who had in 1627 moved the impeachment of
the Duke of Buckingham, and been rewarded with this
Mastership.</p>

<p>Verse 18. Alludes to the rigorous suppression of the
Play-houses (<a href="#Page_285"><i>vide ante</i> p. 285</a>, for a descriptive Song);
and as we see from verse 17, the Bear-garden, like Rope-dancers
and Tumblers, met more tolerance than actors
(except from Colonel Pride). Not heels were feared, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
heads and hands. Bears, moreover, could not stir up
men to loyalty, but tragedy-speeches might. One Joshua
Gisling, a Roundhead, kept bears at Paris Garden, Southwark.</p>

<p>23. “Goodman <i>Lenthall</i>,” “neither wise nor witty,”
(“that creeps to the house by a backdoor,” <i>Rump</i>, ii.
185,) the Speaker of the Commons from 1640 to 1653;
Alderman <i>Allen</i>, the dishonest and bankrupt goldsmith,
both rebuked by <i>Cromwell</i>, when he forcibly expelled the
Rump. (See the ballad on pp. 62-5 of <i>M. D., C.</i>, verses
9 and 10, telling how “<i>Allen</i> the coppersmith was in great
fear. He had done as [i.e. <i>us</i>] much hurt,” &amp;c.; also 2,
15, for the dumb-foundered “Speaker without his Mace.”)
This Downfall of the Rump had been on April 20th, 1653,
not quite three months before the funeral of <i>Dean</i>. Whoever
may have been the writer of this spirited ballad, we
believe, wrote the other one also: judging solely by internal
evidence.</p>

<p>24. <i>Henry Ireton</i>, who married Bridget Cromwell in
January, 1646-7, and escaped from the Royalists after
having been captured at Naseby, proved the worst foe of
Charles, insatiably demanding his death, died in Ireland
of the plague, 15th November, 1651. His body was
brought to Bristol in December, and lay in state at Somerset
House. Over the gate hung the “hatchment”
with “<i>Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori</i>”—which one
of the Cavaliers delightedly translated, “Good it is for
his country that he is dead.” Like Dean’s, two years
later, Ireton’s body was buried with ostentatious pomp in
Henry VII.’s Chapel, (Feb. 6 or 7;) to be ignominiously
treated at Tyburn after the Restoration. The choice of
so royal a resting-place brought late insult on many
another corpse. His widow was speedily married to
Charles Fleetwood, before June, 1652.</p>

<p>In verse 26, we cannot with absolute certainty fill the
blank. Yet, in the absence of disproof, we can scarcely
doubt that the name suppressed was neither <i>Sexby</i>, “an
active agitator,” who, in 1658, employed against Cromwell
“all that restless industry which had formerly been
exerted in his favour” (Hume’s <i>Hist. Engd.</i>, cap. lxi.);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
nor “Doomsday Sedgwick;” not <i>Sidney</i>, staunch Republican,
Algernon Sidney, whose condemnation was in
1687 secured most iniquitously, and whose death more
disgracefully stains the time than the slaughter of Russell,
although sentimentalism chooses the latter, on account
of his wife. Sidney was “but a young member”
at the Dissolution of 20th April, 1653. Probably the
word was <i>Say</i>, the notorious “Say and Seale,” “Crafty
Say,” of whom we read:—</p>

<h5><a href="#Page_213">Page 64 [213].</a> <i>I went from <span class="antiqua">England</span>, &amp;c.</i></h5>

<p>A MS. assertion gives the date of this <i>Cantilena de
Gallico itinere</i> as 1623. There seems to us no good reason
for doubting that the author was <span class="smcap">Dr. Richard
Corbet</span> (1582-1635), Bishop of Oxford, afterwards of
Norwich. It is signed Rich. Corbett in Harl. MS. No.
6931, fol. 32, <i>reverso</i>, and appears among his printed
poems, 3rd edit. 1672, p. 129. In <i>Wit and Mirth</i>, 1684,
p. 76, it is entitled “Dr. Corbet’s Journey,” &amp;c. But it
is fair to mention that we have found it assigned to <span class="smcap">R.
Goodwin</span>, by the epistolary gossip of inaccurate old
Aubrey (see Col. Franc. Cunningham’s <i>“Mermaid edit.”
of Ben Jonson</i>, i. Memoirs, p. lvii. first note). In a recent
edition of Sir John Suckling’s Works, 1874, it is
printed as if by him (“There is little doubt that it is
his”), i. 102, without any satisfactory external evidence
being adduced in favour of Suckling. In fact, the external
evidence goes wholly against the theory. The very
MS. Harl. 367, which is used as authority, is both imperfect
and corrupt throughout, as well as anonymous (<i>ex.
gratiæ</i>, misreading the <i>Bastern</i>, for Bastile), and the date
on it, 1623, will not suit Suckling at all: though Sir Hy.
Ellis is guessed (by his supposed handwriting,) to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
have attributed it to him. Could it be possible that he
was otherwise unacquainted with the poem?</p>

<p>At earlier date than our own copy we find it, by
Aug. 30th, 1656, in <i>Musarum Deliciæ</i>, p. 17, and in
<i>Parnassus Biceps</i>, also 1656, p. 24. From this (as well
as Harl. MS. 367) we gain corrections printed as
our <i>marginalia</i>, <a href="#Page_214">pp. 214-6</a>: <i>deserv’d</i>, for received;
<i>statue</i> stairs, At <i>Nôtre Dame</i>; prate, <i>doth</i> please,
&amp;c. Harl. MS. 367 reads “The Indian <i>Roc</i>” [probably
it is correct]; and “As great and wise as Luisuè”
[Luines, who died 1622]. <i>Parnassus Biceps</i> has an extra
verse, preceding the one beginning “His Queen,” (and
Harl. 367 has it, but inferior):—</p>

<p>In the 1662 <i>Rump</i>, i. 39; and in <i>Loyal Songs</i>, 1731, i. 12.
It is also in <i>Parnassus Biceps</i> so early as 1656, p. 159,
where we obtain a few peculiar readings; even in the
first line, which has “of England’s fate;” “Prin <i>and</i>
Burton;” “<i>wear <span class="antiqua">Italian</span> locks for their abuse</i> (instead of
“Stallion locks for a bush”); They’ll only have private
<i>keyes</i> for their use,” &amp;c. We are inclined to accept these
as correct readings, although our text (agreeing with the
<i>Rump</i>) holds an intelligible meaning. But those who
have inspected the curiosities preserved in the Hôtel de
Cluny, at Paris, can scarcely have forgotten “the Italian
[pad-] Locks” which jealous husbands imposed upon
their wives, as a preservative of chastity, whenever they
themselves were obliged to leave their fair helpmates at
home; and the insinuation that Prynne and Burton intended
to introduce such rigorous precautions, nevertheless
retaining “private keyes” for their own use, has a
covert satire not improbable to have been intentional.
Still, remembering the persistent war waged by these intolerant
Puritans against “the unloveliness of love-locks,”
there are sufficient claims for the text-reading: in their
denunciation of curled ringlets “as Stallion locks” hung
out “for a bush,” or sign of attraction, such as then
dangled over the wine-shop door (and may still be seen
throughout Italy), although “good wine needs no bush”
to advertise it. Instead of “The brownings,” (i.e. <i>The
Brownists</i>, a sect that arose in the reign of Elizabeth,
founded by Robt. Browne), in final verse, <i>Parnassus
Biceps</i> reads “The Roundheads.” The poem was evidently
written between 1632 and 1642.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Strengthening the probability of “Italian locks” being
the correct reading, we may mention in one of the <i>Rump</i>
ballads, dated 26 January, 1660-1, we find “The Honest
Mens Resolution” is to adopt this very expedient:—</p>

<p>The words of a later Scottish version of “Clout the Cauldron,”

Miscellany</i>, 1724, Pt. i. (p. 96 of 17th edit., 1788.)
Burns mentions a tradition that the song “was composed
on one of the Kenmure family in the Cavalier time.” But
the disguised wooer of the later version is repulsed by the
lady. Ours is undoubtedly the earlier.</p>

<p>A different version of this same song, only half its length,
in four-line stanzas, had appeared in J. Cotgrave’s <i>Wit’s
Interpreter</i>, 1655, p. 124. It is also in the 1671 edition, p.
229; and in <i>Wit and Drollery</i>, 1682 edit., 287, entitled
“The Tobacconist.” We prefer the briefer version,
although bound to print the longer one; bad enough, but
not nearly so gross as another On Tobacco, in <i>Jovial
Drollery</i>, 1656, beginning “When I do smoak my nose
with a pipe of Tobacco.”</p>

<p><i>Audi alterem partem!</i> Five years earlier (May 28th,
1655), William Winstanley had published “A Farewell to
Tobacco,” beginning:—</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The three pipes for two-pence was a cheapening of Tobacco
since the days, not a century before, when for price
it was weighed equally against gold. Our early friend
Arthur Tennyson wrote in one of our (extant) Florentine
sketch-books the following <i>impromptu</i> of his own:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse"><i>I walk’d by myself on the highest of hills,</i></div>

<div class="verse"><i>And gulp’d it in ecstasy down;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>To feel it breathe over my bacca-boiled tongue,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>That so much of its fragrance did need,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And brace up completely a system unstrung</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>For months with this <span class="antiqua">Devil’s own Weed</span>.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But even so early as 1639, Thomas Bancroft had printed,
(written thirteen years before) in his <i>First Booke of Epigrammes</i>,
the following,</p>

as “Time’s great consumer, cause of idlenesse,” and
“Nature’s Idea,” &amp;c., in <i>Wit’s Recreations</i>, 1640-5, because
they are accessible in the recent Reprint (would
that it, <i>Wit Restored</i> and <i>Musarum Deliciæ</i> had been
carefully edited, as they deserved and needed to be; but
even the literal reprint of different issues jumbled together
pell-mell is of temporary service): see vol. ii., pp.
45, 38; and 96, 97, 139, 161, 227, 271. Also p. 430, for
the “Tryumph of Tobacco over Sack and Ale,” attributed

<p class="noindent">and vol. i. p. 195, on “A Scholler that sold his Cussion”
to buy tobacco. It is but an imperfect version on ii. 96,
headed “A Tobacconist” (eight lines), of what we gave
from <i>Le Prince d’Amour</i>: it begins “All dainty meats I
doe defie, || Which feed men fat as swine.” Answered
by No. 317, “On the Tobacconist,” p. 97. By the way:
“Verrinus” in <i>M. D., C.</i>, pp. 10, 364, consult <i>History of

<h5><a href="#Page_237">Page 27 [237].</a> <i>Come Drawer, some Wine.</i></h5>

<p>Probably written by <span class="smcap">Thomas Weaver</span>, and about
1646-8. It is in his collection entitled <i>Love and Drollery</i>,
1654, p. 13. Also in the 1662 <i>Rump</i>, i. 235; and the
<i>Loyal Garland</i>, 1686 (Percy Soc. Reprint, xxix. 31).
Compare a similar Song (probably founded on this one)
by Sir Robt. Howard, in his Comedy, “The Committee,”
Act iv., “Come, Drawer, some Wine, Let it sparkle and
shine,”—or, the true beginning, “Now the Veil is thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
off,” &amp;c. The Committee of Sequestration of Estates
belonging to the Cavaliers sat at Goldsmith’s Hall, while
Charles was imprisoned at Carisbrook, in 1647. A ballad
of that year, entitled “Prattle your pleasure under the
Rose,” has this verse:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse"><i>Under the rose be it spoken, there’s a damn’d <span class="antiqua">Committee</span>,</i></div>

<div class="verse"><i>Only to sequester the poor Cavaliers,—</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The Devil take their souls, and the hangmen their ears.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(As Hamlet says, “You pray not well!”—but such provocation
transfers the blame to those who caused the
anger.)</p>

<p>Again, in another Ballad, “I thank you twice,” dated
21st August, same year, 1647:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse indent4"><i>Still, God a-mercy, Parliament!</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On our <a href="#Page_239">p. 239</a>, it is amusing to find reference to “the
Cannibals of Pym,” remembering how Lilburn and others
of that party indulged in similar accusations of cannibalism,
with specific details against “Bloody Bones, or
Lunsford” (<i>Hudibras</i>, Pt. iii. canto 2), who was killed in
1644. Thus, “From <i>Lunsford</i> eke deliver us, || That
eateth up children” (Rump i. 65); and Cleveland writes,
“He swore he saw, when <i>Lunsford</i> fell, || A child’s arm
in his pocket” (J. C. <i>Revived, Poems</i>, 1662, p. 110).</p>

<h5><a href="#Page_240">Page 32 [240].</a> <i>Listen, Lordings, to my story.</i></h5>

<p>With the music, this reappears in <i>Pills to p. Mel</i>., 1719,
iv. 84, entitled “The Glory of all Cuckolds.” Variations
few, and unimportant: “The Man in Heaven’s” being
a very doubtful reading. In the Douce Collection, iv. 41,
42, are two broadsides, A New Summons to Horn Fair,
beginning “You horned fumbling Cuckolds, In City,
court, or Town,” and (To the women) “Come, all you
merry jades, who love to play the game,” with capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
wood-cuts: Jn Pitts, printer. They recal Butler’s description
of the Skrimmington. The joke was much
relished. Thus, in <i>Lusty Drollery</i>, 1656, p. 106, is a
Pastorall Song, beginning:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

finally by his wife.</p>

<h5><a href="#Page_240">Page 33 [Supp. 6].</a> <i>Discourses of late, &amp;c.</i></h5>

<p>Also, earlier in <i>Musarum Deliciæ</i>, 1656, (Reprint, p. 48)
as “The Louse’s Peregrinations,” but without the sixth
verse. <i>Breda</i>, in the Netherlands, was beseiged by
Spinola for ten months, and taken in 1625. <i>Bergen</i>, in
our text, is a corrupt reading.</p>

<h5><a href="#Page_241">Page 38 [241].</a> <i>From <span class="antiqua">Essex</span>-Anabaptist Lawes.</i></h5>

<p>We do not understand whence it cometh that the most
bitter non-conformity and un-Christian crazes of enthusiasm
seem always to have thriven in Essex and the
adjacent Eastern coast-counties, so far as Lincolnshire,
but the fact is undeniable. Whether (before draining the
fens, see “The Upland people are full of thoughts,” in
<i>A Crew of kind London Gossips</i>, 1663, p. 65) this proceeded
from their being low-lying, damp, dreary, and
dismal, with agues prevalent, and hypochondria welcome
as an amusement, we leave others to determine. Cabanis
declared that Calvinism is a product of the small intestines;
and persons with weak circulation and slow digestion
are seldom orthodox, but incline towards fanaticism
and uncompromising dissent. Your lean Cassius is a
pre-ordained conspirator. Plain people, whether of
features or dwelling-place, think too much of themselves.
Mountaineers may often hold superstitions, but of the
elemental forces and higher worship. They possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
moreover a patriotic love of their native hills, which
makes them loth to quit, and eager to revisit them, with
all their guardian powers: the <i>nostalgia</i> and <i>amor patriæ</i>
are strongest in Highlanders, Switzers, Spanish muleteers,
and even Welsh milkmaids. It was from flat-coasted
Essex that most of the “peevish Puritans” emigrated to
Holland, and thence to America, when discontented with
every thing at home.</p>

<p>The form of a Le’tanty or Litany, for such mock-petitions
as those in our text (not found elsewhere), and
in <i>M. D., C.</i>, p. 174, continued in favour from the uprise of
the Independents (simply because they hated Liturgies),
for more than a century. In the King’s Pamphlets, in
the various collections of <i>Loyal Songs</i>, <i>Songs on affairs of
State</i>, the <i>Mughouse Diversions</i>, <i>Pills to purge State
Melancholly</i>, <i>Tory Pills</i>, &amp;c., we possess them beyond
counting, a few being attributed to Cleveland and to
Butler. One, so early as 1600, “Good Mercury, defend
us!” is the work of Ben Johnson.</p>

<p>Verse 1.—The “Brownist’s Veal” refers to Essex
calves, and the scandal of one Green, who is said to have
been a Brownist. 4.—“From her that creeps up Holbourne
hill:” the cart journey from Newgate to the “tree

Oct. 1654, Cromwell was thrown from the coach-box in

<p class="noindent">“An old Aunt”—this term used by Autolycus, had temporary
significance apart from kinship, implying loose
behaviour; even as “nunkle” or uncle, hails a mirthful
companion. In Roxb. Coll., i. 384, by L[aur.] P[rice],
printed 1641-83, is a description of three Aunts, “seldom
cleanly,” but they were genuine relations, though “the
best of all the three” seems well fitted by the <i>Letany</i>
description: which <i>may</i> refer to her.</p>

<p>We come delightedly, as a relief, upon this racy and
jovial Love-song, which redeems the close of the volume.
It has the gaiety and <i>abandon</i> of John Fletcher’s and
Richard Brome’s. We have never yet met it elsewhere.
It was probably written about 1642. The reserved song
in Part i., p. 153 (Supplement, p. 3), seems to be a vile
parody on it, in the coarse fashion of those persons who
disgraced the cause of the Cavaliers. The rank and file
were often base, and their brutality is evidenced in the
songs which we have been obliged to degrade to the Supplement.</p>

<p>It was certainly popular before 1659, for we find it
quoted as furnishing the tune to “A proper new ballad
(25 verses) on the Old Parliament,” beginning “Good
Morrow, my neighbours all,” with a varying burden:—</p>

mentioned on our <a href="#Page_231">p. 231</a>, the 1670 edition was reissued
as a new edition in 1691, but with no alteration
except the fresh title-page, with its date and statement
of William Miller’s stock in trade.</p>

<p>Of the four “Lovers of Wit,” 1661, we believe we
have unearthed one, viz. “R. S.,” in <span class="smcap">Ralph Sleigh</span>,
who wrote a song beginning, “<i>Cupid, Cupid</i>, makes
men stupid; I’ll no more of such boys’ play;” (<i>Sportive
Wit</i>,) <i>Jovial Drollery</i>, 1656, p. 22.</p>

alludes to Oliver Cromwell: His being “King and no
King,” to his refusing the Crown offered by the notables
whom he had summoned in 1657. As the “New Peers,”
his sons Henry and Richard among them, insulted and
contemned by the later and mixed Parliament of January
20th, 1658, were “turned out” along with their foes the
recalcitrant Commons, on Feb. 4th, we have the date of
this ballad established closely.</p>

<h5>Page 36, lines 21, 22. <i>“Honest Dick;” and “L.”</i></h5>

<p>These lines furnish a clue to the date of this ballad, (and
its “Answer” quickly followed): “Honest Dick” being
Richard Cromwell, whose Protectorate lasted only eight
months, beginning in September, 1658. “The name
with an L—” refers to his unscrupulous rival Lambert;
with his spasmodic attempts at supremacy, urged on by
his own ambition and that of his wife (accustomed too
long to rule Oliver himself, during a close intimacy, not
without exciting scandal, while she insisted on displacing
Lady Dysart). For an account of Lambert’s twenty-one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
years of captivity, first at Guernsey and later at Plymouth,
see <i>Choice Notes on History, from N. and Q.</i>, 1858,
pp. 155-163. Lambert played a selfish game, lost it, and
needs no pity for having had to pay the stakes. But for
“Honest Dick,” “Tumble down Dick,” who had warmly
pleaded with his father to save the king’s life in the fatal
January of 1649, we keep a hearty liking. Carlyle stigmatizes
him as “poor, idle, trivial,” &amp;c., but let that pass.
Had Richard been crafty or cruel, like those who removed
him from power, his reign might have been prolonged.
But “what a wounded name” he would have then left
behind, compared with his now stainless character: and,
in any case, his ultimate fall was certain.</p>

<h5>Page 43, line 16th, “<i>Call for a constable blurt.</i>”</h5>

<p>An allusion to Middleton’s Comedy, “Blurt, Master
Constable,” 1602.</p>

<h5>Page 62, 368. <i>Will you hear a strange thing.</i></h5>

<p>The important event here described took place April 20th,
1653, and the ballad immediately followed. (Compare
“Cheer up, kind country men,” by S. S., “Rebellion
hath broken up house,” and “This Christmas time,” in
the Percy Soc. Pol. Bds., iii. 126; 180 <i>Loyal Songs</i>, 149,
1694; <i>Rump</i>, ii. 52.) At this date the strife between the
fag-end of the Rump and Oliver, who was supported by
his council of officers, came to open violence. Fearing
his increased power, it was proposed to strengthen the
Parliamentarians by admitting a body of “neutrals,”
Presbyterians, to act in direct opposition against the
army-leaders. With a pretence of dissolving themselves
there would have ensued a virtual extension of rule.
Anxious and lengthy meetings had been held by Cromwell’s
adherents at Whitehall, one notably on the 19th,
and continued throughout the night. Despite a promise,
or half promise, of delay made to him, the Rump was
meantime hurrying onward the objectionable measure,
clearly with intention of limiting his influence: among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the leaders being Sir Hy. Vane, Harry Marten, and Algernon
Sidney. They knew it to be a struggle for life or
death. From the beginning, this Long Parliament cherished
the mistaken idea that they were everything supreme:
providence, strength, virtue, and wisdom, etc.,
etc. If mere empty talk could be all this, such representative
wind-bags might deserve some credit. Their doom
was sealed; not alone for their incompetence, but also for
proved malignity, and the attempt to perpetuate their own
mischief, destroying the only power that seemed able to
bring order out of chaos.</p>

<p>Cromwell received intelligence, from his adherents
within the house, of the efforts being made to hurry the
measure for settling the new representation, and then to
dissolve for re-election. Major Harrison talked against
time; until Cromwell could arrive after breaking up the
Whitehall meeting. Ingoldsby, as the second or third
messenger, had shown to him the urgent need of action.
Followed by Lambert and some half-dozen officers, the
General took with him a party of soldiers, reached the
house, and found himself not too soon. Surrounding the
chamber, and guarding the doors, the troopers remained
outside. Clad in plain black, unattended and resolute,
Oliver entered, stood looking on his discomfitted foes, and
then sat down, speaking to no one except “dusky tough
St. John, whose abstruse fanaticisms, crabbed logics, and
dark ambitions issue all, as was natural, in decided avarice”
(Carlyle’s <i>Cromwell</i>, iii. 168, 1671 edit.). Vane
must have felt the peril, but held on unflinchingly, imploring
the house to dispense with everything that might
delay the measure, such as engrossing. The Speaker
had risen at last to put the question, before the General
started up, uncovered, and began his address. Something
of stately commendation for past work he gave
them. Perhaps at first his words were uttered solely to
obtain a momentary pause, the whilst he gathered up his
strength, and measured all the chances, before he broke
with them for ever. Soon the tone changed into that of
anger and contempt. He heaped reproaches on them:
Ludlow says: “He spoke with so much passion and discomposure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
of mind, as if he had been distracted.” “Your
time is come!” he told them: “The Lord has done with
you. He has chosen other instruments for the carrying
on his work, that are more worthy.”</p>

<p>Vane, Marten, and Sir Peter Wentworth tried to interrupt
him, but it was almost beyond their power. Wentworth
could but irritate him by indignant censure. He
crushed his hat on, sprang from his place, shouting that
he would put an end to their prating, and, while he strode
noisily along the room, railed at them to their face, not
naming them, but with gestures giving point to his invectives.
He told them to begone: “I say you are no
Parliament! I’ll put an end to your sitting. Begone!
Give way to honester men.” A stamp of his foot followed,
as a signal; the door flies open, “five or six files
of musqueteers” are seen with weapons ready. Resistance
(so prompt, with less provocation, in 1642) is felt to
be useless, and, except mere feminine scolding, none is
attempted. Not one dares to struggle. Afraid of violence,
their swords hang idly at their side. As they pass
out in turn, they meet the scathing of Oliver’s rebuke.
His control of himself is gone. Their crimes are not forgotten.
He denounces Challoner as a drunkard, Wentworth
for his adultery, Alderman Allen for his embezzlement
of public military money, and Bulstrode Whitelock
of injustice. Harry Marten is asked whether a whore-master
is fit to sit and govern. Vane is unable to resist
a feeble protest, availing nothing—“This is not honest:
Yea! it is against morality and honesty.” In the absence
of such crimes or flagrant sins of his companions, as
his own frozen nature made him incapable of committing,
there are remembered against him his interminable
harangues, his hair-splitting, his self-sufficiency; and all
that early deliberate treachery in ransacking his father’s
papers, which he employed to cause the death of Strafford.
To all posterity recorded, came the ejaculation of
Cromwell: “Sir Harry Vane, Sir Harry Vane—the
Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane!” And, excepting
a few dissentient voices, the said posterity echoes the
words approvingly. The “bauble” mace had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
borne off ignominiously, the documents were seized, including
that of the unpassed measure, the room was
cleared, the doors were locked, and all was over. The
Long Parliament thus fell, unlamented.</p>

<h5>Pages 87, 369. <i>Some Christian people all, &amp;c.</i></h5>

<p>We have traced this burlesque narrative of the Fire on
London Bridge ten years earlier than <i>Merry Drollery</i>,
1661, p. 81. It appeared (probably for the first time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
print) on April 28th, 1651, at the end of a volume of <i>facetiæ</i>,
entitled <i>The Loves of Hero and Leander</i> (in the 1677
edition, following <i>Ovid de Arte Amandi</i>, it is on p. 142).
The event referred to, we suspect, was a destructive fire
which broke out on London Bridge, 13th Feb. 1632-3.
It is thus described:—“At the latter end of the year
1632, viz., on the 13th Feb., between eleven and twelve
at night, there happened in the house of one Briggs, a
needle-maker, near St. Magnus Church, at the north
end of the bridge, by the carelessness of a maid-servant,
setting a tub of hot sea-coal ashes under a pair of stairs,
a sad and lamentable fire, which consumed all the buildings
before eight of the clock the next morning, from the
north end of the bridge, to the first vacancy on both
sides, containing forty-two houses; <i>water being then very
scarce, the Thames being almost frozen over</i>. Beneath,
in the vaults and cellars, the fire remained burning and
glowing a whole week after. After which fire, the north
end of the bridge lay unbuilt for many years; only deal
boards were set up on both sides, to prevent people’s
falling into the Thames, many of which deals were, by
high winds, blown down, which made it very dangerous
in the nights, although there were lanthorns and candles
hung upon all the cross-beams that held the pales together.”
(Tho. Allen’s <i>Hist. and Antiq. of London</i>, vol.
ii. p. 468, 1828.) Details and list of houses burnt are given
(as in <i>Gent. Mag.</i> Nov. 1824), from the MS. <i>Record
of the Mercies of God; or, a Thankfull Remembrance</i>,
1618-1635 (since printed), kept by the Puritan Nehemiah
Wallington, citizen and turner, of London, a friend of
Prynn and Bastwick. He gives the date as Monday, 11th
February, 1633. Our ballad mentions the river being
frozen over, and “all on the tenth of January;” but nothing
is more common than a traditional blunder of the
month, so long as the rhythm is kept. (Compare <i>Choyce
Drollery</i>, <a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>, and Appendix <a href="#Page_297">p. 297</a>).</p>

<p>Another Fire-ballad (in addition to the coarse squib in
present vol., <a href="#Page_33">pp. 33-7</a>,) is “Zeal over-heated;” telling of
a fire at Oxford, 1642; tune, Chivey Chace; and beginning,

words on D’Avenant. Since printing <i>M. D. C.</i>, we have
been enabled (thanks to W. F. Fowle, Esq., possessor of)
to consult the very rare Second Satire, 1655, mentioned
on p. 371. It is entitled, “The Incomparable Poem
<span class="smcap">Gondibert Vindicated</span> from the Wit-Combats of Four
<span class="smcap">Esquires</span>, <i>Clinias</i>, <i>Dametas</i>, <i>Sancho</i>, and <i>Jack Pudding</i>.”

<p class="noindent">Printed in the year 1655.” It begins on p. 3, with a
poetical address to Sir Willm. Davenant, asking pardon
beforehand in case his “yet-unhurt Reputation” should
suffer more through the champion than from the attack
made by the four “Cyclops, or Wit-Centaurs,” two of
whom he unhesitatingly names as “Denham and Jack
Donne,” or “Jack Straw.” But even thus early we
notice the sarcasm against D’Avenant himself: when in
reference to the never-forgotten “flaws” in his face, the
Defender writes:—</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the popularity of Suckling’s
“Ballad on a Wedding” (probably written in 1642)
caused innumerable imitations. Some of these we have
indicated. In <i>Folly in Print</i>, 1667, is another, “On a
Friend’s Wedding,” to the same tune, beginning, “Now
<i>Tom</i>, if <i>Suckling</i> were alive, And knew who <i>Harry</i> were
to wive.” In D’Urfey’s <i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>,
1699, p. 81: ed. 1719, iii, 65, is a different “New Ballad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
upon a Wedding” [at Lambeth], with the music, to
same tune and model, beginning, “The sleeping <i>Thames</i>

<p>The mention, on pp. 116, of “our bold Army” turning
out the “black Synod,” refers less probably to Colonel
“<i>Pride’s Purge</i>” of the Presbyterians, on 6th December,
1648, than to the events of April 20, 1653; and helps to
fix the date to the same year. In 6th verse the blanks
are to be thus filled, “Arms of the <i>Rump</i> or the <i>King</i>;”
“C. R., or O. P.;” the joke of “the breeches” being a

<h5>Pages 125, 315. <i>Lay by, &amp;c., Law lies a-bleeding.</i></h5>

<p>The date of this ballad seems to have been 1656, rather
than 1658. The despotism of the sword here so powerfully
described, was under those persons who are on
p. 254 of <i>M. D. C.</i> designated “Oliver’s myrmidons,”
meaning, probably, chiefly the major-generals of the
military districts, into which the country was divided
after Penruddock’s downfall in 1655. They were Desborough,
Whalley, Goffe, Fleetwood, “downright”
Skippon, Kelsey, Butler, Worseley, and Berry; to these
ten were added Barkstead. Compare Hallam’s account:—“These
were eleven in number, men bitterly hostile to
the royalist party, and insolent to all civil authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
They were employed to secure the payment of a tax of
ten per cent., imposed by Cromwell’s arbitrary will on
those who had ever sided with the King during the late
wars, where their estates exceeded £100 per annum.
The major-generals, in their correspondence printed
among Thurloe’s papers, display a rapacity and oppression
greater than their master’s. They complain that
the number of those exempted is too great; they press
for harsher measures; they incline to the unfavourable
construction in every doubtful case; they dwell on the
growth of malignancy and the general disaffection. It
was not indeed likely to be mitigated by this unparalleled
tyranny. All illusion was now gone as to the pretended
benefits of the civil war. It had ended in a despotism,
compared to which all the illegal practices of former
kings, all that had cost Charles his life and crown,
appeared as dust in the balance. For what was Ship-money,
a general burthen, by the side of the present
decimation of a single class, whose offence had long been
expiated by a composition and effaced by an act of
indemnity? or were the excessive punishments of the
Star Chamber so odious as the capital executions inflicted
without trial by peers, whenever it suited the
usurper to erect his high court of justice [by which Gerard
and Vowel in 1654, Slingsby and Dr. Hewit in 1658 fell]?
A sense of present evils not only excited a burning desire
to live again under the ancient monarchy, but obliterated,
especially in the new generation, that had no distinct
remembrance of them, the apprehension of its former
abuses.” (<i>Constitutional Hist. England</i>, cap. x. vol. ii.
p. 252, edit. 1872.) This from a writer unprejudiced and
discriminating.</p>

<h5>Pages 131, 376. <i>I’ll tell you a story.</i></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Tower hill and Tyburn.</span> The date of this ferocious
ballad is not likely to have been long before the execution
of the regicides Harrison, Hacker, Cook, and Hew
Peters, in October, 1660; some on the 13th, others on
the 16th. Probably, shortly before the trial of Harry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
Marten, on the 10th of the same month. The second
verse indicates a considerable lapse of time since Monk’s
arrival and the downfall of the Rump (burnt in effigy,
Febr. 11, 1659-60); so we may be certain that it was
written late, about September, if not actually at beginning
of October.</p>

<p>Sir Robert <span class="smcap">Tichbourne</span>, Commissioner for sale of
State-lands, Alderman, Regulator of Customs, and Lord
Mayor in 1658, was named in the King’s Proclamation,
6th June, 1660, as one of those who had fled, and who
were summoned to appear within fourteen days, on
penalty of being exempted from any pardon. His name
occurs again, among the exceptions to the Act of Indemnity;
along with those of Thos. Harrison, Hy. Marten,
John Hewson, Jn. Cook, Hew Peters, Francis Hacker,
and other forty-five. Nineteen of these fifty-one surrendered
themselves: Tichbourne and Marten among them.
None of them were executed; although Scoop was, who
also had yielded. The trial of the regicides commenced
on 9th October, at Hick’s Hall, Clerkenwell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugh Peters</span> suffered, along with <span class="smcap">John Cook</span> (the
Counsel against Charles I.) “that read the King’s
charge,” on the 16th October. He was depressed in
spirits at the last, but there was dignity in his reply to
one who insulted him in passing—“Friend, you do not
well to trample on a dying man;” and his sending a
token to his daughter awakens pity. Physically he had
failed in courage, and no wonder, to face all that was
arrayed to terrify him: or he might have justified anticipations
and “made a pulpit of the place.” His last
sermon at Newgate is said to have been “incoherent.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry Marten’s</span> private life is so generally declared
to have been licentious (dozens of ballads referring to his
“harem,” “Marten’s girl that was neither sweet nor
sound,” “Marten, back and leave your wench,” &amp;c.),
and his old friend Cromwell when become a foe openly
taxing him as a “whoremaster,” that it is better for us
to think of him with reference to his unswerving faithfulness
in Republican opinions; his gay spirit (more resembling
the reckless indifference of Cavaliers than his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
associates can have esteemed befitting); his successful
exertions on many occasions to save the shedding of
blood; and his gallant bearing in the final hours of trial.
The living death to which he was condemned, of his
twenty years imprisonment at Chepstow Castle, has been
recorded (mistakenly as <i>thirty</i>) by that devoted student
Robert Southey, <i>clarum et venerabilem nomen!</i> in a
poem which can never pass into oblivion, although cleverly
mocked by Canning in the Anti-Jacobin, Nov. 20, 1797:—</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> Royal Exchange, Sir Thomas Gresham’s
Bourse, was opened by Queen Elizabeth, January 23rd,
1570, and destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666. The
<i>second</i> was commenced on May 6th, 1667, and burnt on
January 10th, 1838. The present building, the <i>third</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
was opened by Queen Victoria Oct., 28th, 1844. The
“Old Exchange,” often referred to in ballads, was
Gresham’s. But the “New Exchange” was one, erected
where the stables of Durham House in the Strand had
stood: opened April 11th, 1609, and removed in 1737.
King James I. had named it “Britain’s Bourse.” Built
on the model of the established Royal Exchange, it had
“cellars, a walk, and a row of shops, filled with milliners,
seamstresses, and those of similar occupations; and was
a place of fashionable resort. What, however, was intended
to rival the Royal Exchange, dwindled into frivolity
and ruin, and the site is at present [1829] occupied by a
range of handsome houses facing the Strand” (T. Allen’s
<i>Hist. and Antiq. of London</i>, iv. 254). In the ballad it is
sung of as “Haberdashers’ Hall.” Cp. Roxb. Coll., ii.,
230.</p>

a broadside in Roxb. Coll., i. 466, originally printed for
Francis Grove [1620-55]. 2nd verse reads:—Her husband
<i>Hymen</i>; 4th. <i>Wandring <span class="antiqua">eye</span>; insatiate</i>. The gifts
of Juno, Flora, and Diana follow; with woman’s employment
of them.</p>

in <i>Sportive Wit</i>, same year, p. 39. We gained the corrections,
which we inserted as <i>marginalia</i>, from the MS.;
“<i>Ceres</i> in <i>hir</i> Garland” having been corrupted into
“<i>Cealus</i> in <i>his</i>.” “<i>Aglaura</i>,” Sir John Suckling’s play,

1638, and is here referred to. Probably the date of the
poem is nearly as early. On p. 175 the “Pilgrimage up

Tyburn. (See p. 365).</p>

For the second part of the broad-sheet version we must

reprint of the <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i> (now happily arrived at
completion of the first massive folio vol. of Major Pearson’s
original pair; the bulky third and slim fourth vols.
being afterwards added). We promised to give it, and
gladly would have done so, if we had space: for it is a
trustworthy picture of a Bedlamite’s sufferings, under the
harsh treatment of former days. Date about 1635-42.</p>

<p>To our enumeration of mad songs (<i>Westm. Droll.</i> App.

<p>“I’ll drink to thee a brace of quarts || Whose Anagram

gives us “Stuart here!” which, like drinking “to the
King—<i>over the water</i>!” in later days by the Jacobites,
would be well understood by suspected cavaliers.</p>

<p>In March 1659-60 appeared the anagram “Charles
Stuart: Arts Chast Rule.” Later: Awld fool, Rob the

there begins, “The best of Poets write of Hogs, And of
<i>Ulysses</i> barking Dogs; Others of Sparrows, Flies, and
Hogs.” Our text, though later, seems to be the better,
and has three more verses: “Frogs,” in connection with
“the Best of Poets,” referring to Homer and to <i>Batrachomyomachia</i>;
supposed to be his, and translated by
George Chapman, about 1623 (of whom A. C. Swinburne
has recently written so glowing a eulogium, coupling with
it the noblest praise of Marlowe).</p>

is here,” &amp;c. Wilkins prints an inferior version of 7th
line in 3rd verse, as “Take <i>Prynne</i> and his clubs, or <i>Say</i>
and his tubs,” referring to William, Viscount “Say and
Seal.” Ours reads “club, or <i>Smec</i> and his tub,” the
allusion being to <i>Smectymnuus</i>, a name compounded, like
the word <i>Cabal</i> in Charles II.’s time, of the initials of
five personal names: Ste. Marshall, Edm. Calamy,
Thos. Young, Matth. Newcomen, and Willm. Spurstow;
all preachers, who united in a book against Episcopacy
and the Liturgy. Milton, in 1641 published his <i>Animadversions
upon the Remonstrants Defence against Smectymnuus</i>;
and in 1642, <i>An Apology for Smectymnuus</i>. John
Cleveland devotes a poem to “The Club Divines,” beginning
“Smectymnuus! the Goblin makes me start.”

It was defeated in 1650, the vessels having been intercepted

<p>After Cromwell’s designating the Battle of Worcester,
3rd September, 1651, his “crowning victory” many of
his more uncompromising Republicans kept a stealthy
eye upon him. Our ballad evidently refers itself to the
date of the “purified” Parliament’s “Petition and
Advice,” March 26, 1656, when Cromwell hesitated before
accepting or declining the offered title of King; thinking
(mistakenly, as we deem probable) that his position would
become more unsafe, from the jealousy and prejudices of
the army, than if he seemed contented with the name of
Protector to the Commonwealth, while holding the actual
power of sovereignty. His refusal was in April, 1657.
Hallam thinks it was not until after Worcester fight that
“he began to fix his thoughts, if not on the dignity of
royalty, yet on an equivalent right of command. Two
remarkable conversations, in which Whitelock bore a
part, seem to place beyond controversy the nature of his
designs. About the end of 1651, Whitelock himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
St. John, Widdrington, Lenthall, Harrison, Desborough,
Fleetwood, and Whalley met Cromwell, at his own
request to consider the settlement of the nation,” &amp;c.
(<i>Constit. Hist. England</i>, cap. x. p. 237, edit. 1872.)
“Twelve months after this time in a more confidential
discourse with Whitelock alone, the general took occasion
to complain both of the chief officers of the army and of
the parliament,” &amp;c. (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 238). The conference not
being satisfactory to Cromwell, on each occasion ended
abruptly; and Whitelock (if we may trust his own
account, which perhaps is asking too much) was little
consulted afterwards. When they had conferred the
title of Lord Protector, the right of appointing his successor
was added on 22nd May.</p>

<h5>Pages 255, 393. <i>When I do travel, &amp;c.</i></h5>

<p>“With upsie freeze I line my head,” of our text, is in the
play “Cromwell’s Coronation” printed “With <i>tipsy</i>
frenzie.” But we often find the other phrase; sometimes,
as in the ballad of “The Good Fellow’s Best Beloved”
(i.e. strong drink) varied thus, “With good <i>ipse
he</i>,” (about 1633). See Bd. Soc. <i>Roxb. Bds.</i> iii. 248,
where is W. Chappell’s note, quoting Nares:—“It has
been said that <i>op-zee</i>, in Dutch, means ‘over sea,’ which
cones near to another English phrase for drunkenness,
being ‘half-seas over.’ But <i>op-zyn-fries</i> means, ‘in the
Dutch fashion,’ or <i>à la mode de Frise</i>, which perhaps is
the best interpretation of the phrase.” In Massinger and
Decker’s “Virgin Martyr,” 1622, Act ii. sc. 1, we find
the vile Spungius saying, “<i>Bacchus</i>, the God of brewed
wine and sugar, grand patron of rob-pots, <i>upsie freesie</i>
tipplers, and <i>super-naculum</i> takers,” &amp;c. Probably
Badham’s conjecture is right, and in Hamlet, i. 4, we
should read not “up-spring,” but</p>

is the name of the frier. Like “Wassael” and “Trinkael,”
the phrase upsie-friese, or vrijster, seems to have
been used as a toast, perhaps for “To your sweetheart.”</p>

<h5>Pages 259, 354. <i>If none be offended.</i></h5>

<p>The exact date of this ballad’s publication was 31st December,
1659: in <i>Thomason Collection</i>, Numero xxii.,
folio, Brit. Mus.</p>

<h5>Page 270. <i>Pray why should any, &amp;c.</i></h5>

<p>Probably written in 1659-60, when Monk was bridling
the Commons. “Cooks” alludes to John Cook, the
Solicitor for the Commonwealth, who at the trial of
Charles Ist. exhibited the charge of high treason. After
the Restoration, Cook was executed along with Hugh
Peters, 16th Oct., 1660, at Charing Cross.</p>

<h5>Pages 283 (line 22), 395. <i>I have the finest Nonperel.</i></h5>

<p>“<i>Hyrens</i>” (as earlier printed in <i>Wit and Drollery</i>, 1656,
p. 26), instead of “Syrens” of our text, is probably
correct. Ancient Pistol twice asks “Have we not <i>Hirens</i>
here?” (<i>Henry</i> IV., Part 2nd, Act ii. sc. 4). George
Peele had a play, now lost, on “The Turkish Mahomet
and Hiren the fair Greek” [1594?] In the <i>Spiritual
Navigator</i>, 1615, we learn, is a passage, “There be
Syrens in the sea of the world. <i>Syrens?</i> <i>Hirens</i>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
they are now called. What a number of these syrens,
hirens, cockatrices, courteghians—in plain English, harlots—swimme
amongst us!”</p>

<h5>Page 287. Title, “<i>Oxford Feasts.</i>”</h5>

<p>An unfortunate misprint crept in, detected too late: for
“<i>Feasts</i>” read properly “<i>Jeasts</i>:” the old fashioned
initial <i>J</i> being barred across like <i>F</i>.</p>

<h5>Page 293, line 11. “<i>Heresie in hops.</i>”</h5>

<p>This must have been an established jest. Compare Introd.
to <i>M. D., C.</i>, pp. xxxi-ii. and T. Randolph’s “Fall
of the Mitre Tavern,” Cambridge, before 1635,</p>

<h5>Page 295, line 24. “<i>A hundred horse.</i>”</h5>

<p>“He that gave the King a hundred horse,” refers, no
doubt, to Sir John Suckling and his loyal service in 1642.
See introduction to <i>M. D., C.</i>, pp. xix. xx. The Answer
to “I tell thee, Jack, thou gavest the King,” there mentioned,
and probably referring to Sir John Mennis, a
carping rival although a Cavalier, has a smack of Cleveland
about it (it certainly is not Suckling’s):—</p>

Three MSS., the Auchinlech, Cambridge University,

of Hamptoun</i>, with his slaying the wild boar; his sword
<i>Morglay</i> is often mentioned, like Arthur’s <i>Excalibur</i>:
Ascapard, the thirty-feet-long giant, who after a fierce
battle becomes page to Sir Bevis. Caius Coll. MS. and
others have the story <i>Richard Cœur de Leon</i>, but the

abstracts of romances on Arthur, Guy of Warwick, Sir
Bevis, Richard Lion-heart, Sir Eglamour of Artoys, Sir
Isumbras, the Seven Wise Masters, Charlemagne and
Roland, &amp;c., in his <i>Spec. Early English Metrical Romances</i>;
of which J. O. Halliwell writes, in 1848:—“Ellis
did for ancient romance what Percy had previously
accomplished for early poetry.” In passing, we
must not neglect to express the debt of gratitude due to
the managers of the <i>E. E. Text Soc.</i>, for giving scholarly
and trustworthy prints of so many MSS., hitherto almost
beyond reach. For <i>Orlando Inamorato</i> and <i>Orlando
Furioso</i> we must go to Boiardo and Ariosto, or the translators,
Sir John Harrington and W. Stewart Rose.
Dunlop’s <i>Hist. of Fiction</i> gives a slight notice of some of
this ballad’s heroes, including <i>Huon</i> of Bordeaux, the
French <i>Livre de Jason</i>, Prince of the Myrmidons, the
<i>Vie de Hercule</i>, the <i>Cléopâtre</i>, &amp;c. Valentine and Orson
is said to have been written in the reign of Charles VIII.,

a modern version attributed to Mr. Taylor, the actor and
singer, is given, not only in <i>Songs and Ballads of the

by J. H. Dixon; but also in Berger’s <i>Red, White, and

<p>If we are to reckon the “twelve years together by the
ears” from January 4, 1641-2, the abortive attempt of
Charles I. to arrest at the House “the Five Members”
(Pym, Hampden, Haslerig, Denzil Holles, and Strode),
we may guess the date of this ballad to be 1653-4. Verse
14 mentions Oliver breaking the Long Parliament (20th
April, 1653); and verses 15, 16 refer to the Little, or
“Barebones Parliament” July 4, to 2nd December, 1653,
(when power was resigned into the hands of Cromwell).
Shortly after this, but certainly before Sept. 3rd, 1654
(when the next Parliament, more impracticable and
persecuting, met), must be the true date of the ballad.
“<i>Robin</i> the Fool” is “Robin Wisdom,” Robert Andrews.

“Cowardly W——” is probably Philip, Lord Wharton, a
Puritan, and Derby-House committee-man; of inferior

1659. Dr. Isaac <span class="smcap">Dorislaus</span>, Professor of History at
Cambridge, and of Gresham College, apostatized from
Charles I., and was sent as agent by the Commons to
the Hague, where he was in June, 1649, assassinated by
some cavaliers, falsely reported to be commissioned by
the gallant Montrose (see the ballad “What though

Anthony Ascham, sent as Envoy to Spain from the Parliament
in 1649, was slain at Madrid by some Irish officers,
(Rapin:) of whom only one, a Protestant, was executed.

“The women’s war,” often referred to as the “bodkin

“Silly women,” influenced by those who “crept into their

thimbles for support of Parliamentary troops.</p>

<h4 id="APPENDIX_4_3">§ 3.—SESSIONS OF POETS.</h4>

<p>We believe that Sir John Suckling’s Poem, sometimes
called “A Sessions of Wit,” was written in 1636-7;
almost certainly before the death of Ben Jonson (6th
August, 1637). Among its predecessors were Richard
Barnfield’s “Remembrance of some English Poets,”
1598 (given in present volume, <a href="#Page_273">p. 273</a>); and Michael
Drayton’s “Censure of the Poets,” being a Letter in
couplets, addressed to his friend Henry Reynolds; and
the striking lines, “On the Time-Poets,” pp. 5-7 of
<i>Choyce Drollery</i>, 1656. The latter we have seen to be
anonymous; but they were not impossibly by that very
Henry Reynolds, friend of Drayton; although of this
authorship no evidence has yet arisen. Of George
Daniel’s unprinted “Vindication of Poesie,” 1636-47,
we have given specimens on pp. <a href="#Page_272">272</a>, <a href="#Page_280">280-1</a>, and <a href="#Page_331">331-2</a>.
Later than Suckling (who died in 1642), another author
gave in print “The Great Assizes Holden in Parnassus
by Apollo and his Assessors:” at which Sessions are
arraigned Mercurius Britannicus, &amp;c., Feb. 11th, 1644-5.
This has been attributed to George Wither; most erroneously,
as we believe. The mis-appropriation has
arisen, probably, from the fact of Wither’s name being
earliest on the roll of Jurymen summoned:</p>

<div class="verse"><i>Then <span class="antiqua">Cary</span>, <span class="antiqua">May</span>, and <span class="antiqua">Davenant</span> were called forth,</i></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>George Wither was quite capable of placing himself
first on the list, in such a manner, we admit; but it is
incredible to us that, if he had been the author, he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
have described himself so insultingly as we find in the
following lines, and elsewhere:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent8">“<i>he did protest</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>That <span class="antiqua">Wither</span> was a cruell Satyrist;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And guilty of the same offence and crime,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Whereof he was accused at this time:</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Therefore for him hee thought it fitter farre,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>To stand as a Delinquent at the barre,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Then to bee now empanell’d in a Jury.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i><span class="antiqua">George Withers</span> then, with a Poetick fury,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Began to bluster, but <span class="antiqua">Apollo’s</span> frowne</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Made him forbeare, and lay his choler downe.</i>”</div>
</div>
<div class="attr">(<i>Ibid</i>, p. 11.)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Two much more sparkling and interesting “Sessions of
Poets” afterwards appeared, to the tune of Ben Jonson’s
“Cook Laurel.” The first of these begins:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i><span class="antiqua">Apollo</span>, concern’d to see the Transgressions</i></div>

<div class="verse indent1"><i>Severely to punish th’ Abuses of Wit.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i><span class="antiqua">Will d’Avenant</span> would fain have been Steward o’ the Court,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent1"><i>To have fin’d and amerc’d each man at his will;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>But <span class="antiqua">Apollo</span>, it seems, had heard a Report,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent1"><i>That his choice of new Plays did show h’ had no skill.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Besides, some Criticks had ow’d him a spite,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent1"><i>And a little before had made the God fret,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>By letting him know the Laureat did write</i></div>
<div class="verse indent1"><i>That damnable Farce, ‘<span class="antiqua">The House to be Let</span>.’</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Intelligence was brought, the Court being set</i></div>
<div class="verse indent1"><i>That a Play Tripartite was very near made;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Where malicious <span class="antiqua">Matt. Clifford</span>, and spirituall <span class="antiqua">Spratt</span>,</i></div>
<div class="verse indent1"><i>Were join’d with their Duke, a Peer of the Trade,” &amp;c.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The author did not avow himself. It must have been
written, we hold, in 1664-5. The second is variously
attributed to John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, and to
George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, being printed in
the works of both. It begins:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>Since the Sons of the Muses grew num’rous and loud,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>For th’ appeasing so factious and clam’rous a crowd,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i><span class="antiqua">Apollo</span> thought fit in so weighty a cause,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>T’ establish a government, leader, and laws,” &amp;c.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Assembled near Parnassus, Dryden, Etherege, Wycherley,
Shadwell, Nat Lee, Settle, Otway, Crowne, Mrs.
Aphra Behn, Rawlins, Tom D’Urfey, and Betterton, are
in the other verses sketched with point and vivacity; but
in malicious satire. It was probably written in 1677.
Clever as are these two later “Sessions,” they do not
equal Suckling’s, in genial spirit and unforced cheerfulness.</p>

<p>We need not here linger over the whimsical Trial of
Tom D’Urfey and Tom Brown (who squabbled between
themselves, by the bye), in a still later “Sessions of the
Poets Holden at the foot of Parnassus Hill, July the 9th,
1696: London, printed for E. Whitlock, near Stationers’
Hall, 1696”:—a mirthful squib, which does not lay claim
to be called poetry. Nor need we do more than mention
“A Trip to <i>Parnassus</i>; or, the Judgment of <i>Apollo</i> on
Dramatic Authors and Performers. A Poem. London,
1788”—which deals with the two George Colmans,
Macklin, Macnally, Lewis, &amp;c. Coming to our own
century, it is enough to particularize Leigh Hunt’s
“Feast of the Poets;” printed in his “Reflector,”
December, 1811, and afterwards much altered, generally
with improvement (especially in the exclusion of the
spiteful attack on Walter Scott). It begins—<i>“’Tother
day as Apollo sat pitching his darts,” &amp;c.</i> In 1837 Leigh
Hunt wrote another such versical review, viz., “Blue-Stocking
Revels; or, The Feast of the Violets.” This
was on the numerous “poetesses,” but it cannot be
deemed successful. Far superior to it is the clever and
interesting “Fable for Critics,” since written by James
Russell Lowell in America.</p>

<p>Both as regards its own merit, and as being the parent
of many others (none of which has surpassed, or even
equalled it), Sir John Suckling’s “Sessions of Poets”
must always remain famous. We have not space remaining
at command to annotate it with the fulness it
deserves.</p>

<p>Introduction to Merry Drollery (our second volume)
p. xxii. lines 20, 21. Since writing the above, we have
had the pleasure of reading the excellent “Memoir of
Barbara, Duchess of Cleveland,” and the “Althorp
Memoirs,” by G. Steinman Steinman, Esq., F. S. A.,
(printed for Private Circulation, 1871, 1869); by the
former work, p. 22, we are led to discredit Mrs. Jameson’s
assertion that the night of May 29, 1660, was spent by
Charles II. in the house of Sir Samuel Morland at Vauxhall.
“This knight and friend of the King’s <i>may</i> have
had a residence in the parish of Lambeth before the
Restoration, but as he was an Under Secretary of State
at the time, it is more probable that he lived in London;
and <i>as he did not obtain from the Crown a lease of Vauxhall
mansion and grounds until April 19, 1675</i>, the
foundations of a very improbable story, whoever originated
it, are considerably shaken.” Mr. Steinman inclines to
believe the real place of meeting was Whitehall. He
has given a list of Charles II.’s male companions in the
Court at Bruges, with short biographies, in the <i>Archæologia</i>,
xxxv. pp. 335-349. We knew not of this list when
writing our Introduction to <i>Choyce Drollery</i>.</p>

<p>Here the Editor closes his willing toil, (after
having added a <i>Table of First Lines</i>, and a
<i>Finale</i>,) and offers a completed work to the friendly
acceptance of Readers. They are no vague abstractions
to him, but a crowd of well-distinguished faces,
many among them being renowned scholars and genial
critics. To approach them at all might be deemed
temerity, were it not that such men are the least to be
feared by an honest worker. On the other hand, it
were easy for ill-natured persons to insinuate accusations
against any one who meddles with Re-prints of
<i>Facetiæ</i>. Blots and stains are upon such old books,
which he has made no attempt to disguise or palliate.
Let them bear their own blame. There are dullards
and bigots in the world, nevertheless, who decry all
antiquarian and historical research. A defence is unnecessary:
“Let them rave!”</p>

1671, 1672.</p>

<p>To those who are already acquainted with the
two parts of the <i>Westminster Drollery</i>, published
in 1671 and 1672, it must have appeared strange that
no attempt has hitherto been made to bring these delightful
volumes within reach of the students of our
early literature. The originals are of extreme rarity,
a perfect copy seldom being attainable at any public
sale, and then fetching a price that makes a book-hunter
almost despair of its acquisition. So great a
favourite was it in the Cavalier times, that most copies
have been literally worn to pieces in the hands of its
many admirers, as they chanted forth a merry stave
from the pages. <i>There is no collection of songs surpassing
it in the language</i>, and as representative of the
lyrics of the first twelve years after the Restoration
it is unequalled: by far the greater number are elsewhere
unattainable.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Westminster Drolleries</span> are reprinted with
the utmost fidelity, page for page, and line for line,
not a word being altered, or a single letter departing
from the original spelling.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Merry Drollery, Complete</span> is not only
amusing, but as an historical document is
of great value. It is here reproduced,
with the utmost exactitude, for students
of our old literature, from the edition of 1691. The
few rectifications of a corrupt text are invariably held
within square brackets, when not reserved for the
Appendix of Notes, Illustrations, and Emendations.
Thirty-four Songs, additional, that appeared only in
the 1661 edition, will be given separately; the intermediate
edition of 1670 being also collated. A special
Introduction has been prefixed, drawing attention to
the political events of the time referred to, and some
account of the authors of the Songs in this <i>Merry
Drollery</i>.</p>

<p>The work is quite distinct in character from the
<i>Westminster Drolleries</i>, 1671-72, but forms an indispensable
companion to that ten-years-later volume.
Twenty-five songs and poems, that had not appeared
in the 1661 edition, were added to the after editions
of <i>Merry Drollery</i>; but without important change
to the book. It was essentially an offspring of the
Restoration, the year 1660-61, and it thus gives us a
genuine record of the Cavaliers in their festivity.
Whatever is offensive, therefore, is still of historical
importance. Even the bitterness of sarcasm against
the Rump Parliament, under whose rule so many
families had long groaned; the personal invective,
and unsparing ridicule of leading Republicans and
Puritans; were such as not unnaturally had found
favour during the recent Civil War and Usurpation.
The preponderance of Songs in praise of Sack and
loose revelry is not without significance. A few pieces
of coarse humour, <i>double entendre</i>, and breaches of
decorum attest the fact that already among the Cavaliers
were spread immorality and licentiousness. The fault
of an impaired discipline had home evil fruit, beyond
defeat in the field and exile from positions of power.
Mockery and impurity had been welcomed as allies,
during the warfare against bigotry, hypocrisy, and
selfish ambition. We find, it is true, few of the
sweeter graces of poetry in <i>Choice Drollery</i> and in
<i>Merry Drollery</i>; but, instead, much that helps us to a
sounder understanding of the social, military, and
political life of those disturbed times immediately
preceding the Restoration.</p>

<p>Of the more than two hundred pieces, contained in
<i>Merry Drollery</i>, fully a third are elsewhere unattainable,
and the rest are scarce. Among the numerous
attractions we may mention the rare Song of “Love
lies a bleeding” (p. 191), an earnest protest against
the evils of the day; the revelations of intolerant
military violence, such as The Power of the Sword
(125), Mardyke (12), Pym’s Anarchy (70), The Scotch
War (93), The New Medley of the Country-man,
Citizen, and Soldier (182), The Rebel Red-Coat (190),
and “Cromwell’s Coronation” (254), with the masterly
description of Oliver’s Routing the Rump (62). Several
Anti-Puritan Songs about New England are here, and
provincial descriptions of London (95, 275, 323).
Rollicking staves meet us, as from the Vagabond (204),
The Tinker of Turvey (27), The Jovial Loyallist, with
the Answer to it, in a nobler strain, by one who sees
the ruinous vileness of debauchery (pp. 207, 209); and
a multitude of Bacchanalian Catches. The two songs
on the Blacksmith (225, 319), and both of those on
The Brewer (221, 252), referring to Cromwell, are
here; as well as the ferocious exultation over the Regicides
in a dialogue betwixt Tower-hill and Tyburn
(131). More than a few of the spirited Mad-songs
were favourites. Nor are absent such ditties as tell
of gallantry, though few are of refined affection and
exalted heroism. The absurd impossibilities of a
Medicine for the Quartan Ague (277, cf. 170), the sly
humour of the delightful “How to woo a Zealous
Lady” (77), the stately description of a Cock-fight
(242), the Praise of Chocolate (48), the Power of
Money (115), and the innocent merriment of rare
Arthur o’ Bradley’s Wedding (312), are certain to
please. Added, are some of the choicest poems by
Suckling, Cartwright, Ben Jonson, Alexander Brome,
Fletcher, D’Avenant, Dryden, Bishop Corbet, and
others. “The Cavalier’s Complaint,” with the Answer
to it, has true dramatic force. The character of a
Mistress (60), shows one of the seductive Dalilahs who
were ever ready to betray. The lampoons on D’Avenant’s
“Gondibert” (100, 118) are memorials of
unscrupulous ridicule from malicious wits. “News,
that’s No News” (159), with the grave buffoonery of
“The Bow Goose” (153), and the account of a Fire
on London Bridge (87), in the manner of pious ballad-mongers
(the original of our modern “Three Children
Sliding on the Ice”), are enough to make Heraclitus
laugh. Some of the dialogues, such as “Resolved not
to Part” (113), “The Bull’s Feather” (i.e. the Horn, p.
264), and that between a Hare and the hounds that
are chasing him (296), lend variety to the volume;
which contains, moreover, some whimsical stories in
verse, (one being “A Merry Song” of a Husbandman
whose wife gets him off a bad bargain, p. 17: compare
p. 200), told in a manner that would have delighted
Mat Prior in later days.</p>

1660, without repetition. The third volume contains
“<i>Choice Drollery</i>,” 1656, and all of the “<i>Antidote

<p>“It would be a curious though perhaps an unprofitable
speculation, how far the ‘Conservative reaction’ has been
reflected in our literature.... Reprints are an important
part of modern literature, and in them there is a
perceptible relaxation of severity. Their interest is no
longer mainly philological. Of late, the Restoration has
been the favourite period for revival. Its dramatists are
marching down upon us from Edinburgh, and the invasion
is seconded by a royalist movement in Lincolnshire. A
Boston publisher has begun a series of drolleries—intended,
not for the general public, but for those students
who can afford to pay handsomely for their predilection
for the byways of letters.</p>

<p>“The Introduction is delightful reading, with quaint
fancies here and there, as in the ‘imagined limbo of unfinished
books.’ ... There is truth and pathos in his
excuses for the royalist versifiers who ‘snatched hastily,
recklessly, at such pleasures as came within their reach,
heedless of price or consequences.’ We may not admit
that they were ‘outcasts without degradation,’ but we can
hardly help allowing that ‘there is a manhood visible in
their failures, a generosity in their profusion and unrest.
They are not stainless, but they affect no concealment of
faults. Our heart goes to the losing side, even when the
loss has been in great part deserved.’ ... The fact is,
that in his contemplation of the follies and vices of ‘that
very distant time’ he loses all apprehension of their
grosser elements, and retains only an appreciation of their
wit, their elegance, and their vivacity. Without offence
be it said, in Lancelot’s phrase, ‘he does something
smack, something grow to; he has a kind of taste,’—and
so have we too, as we read him. These trite and ticklish
themes he touches with so charming a liberality that his
generous allowance is contagious. We feel in thoroughly
honest company, and are ready to be heartily charitable
along with him. For his is no unworthy tolerance of vice,
still less any desire to polish its hardness into such factitious
brilliancy as glistens in Grammont. It is a manly
pity for human weakness, and an unwillingness to see,
much less to pry into, human depravity. ‘It would have
been a joy for us to know that these songs were wholly
speck must go hungry through many an orchard, even
unobjectionable; but he who waits to eat of fruit without
past the apples of the Hesperides.’ ... The little book
is well worth the attention of any one desirous to have a
bird’s-eye view of the Restoration ‘Society.’ Its scope is
far wider than its title would indicate. The ‘Drolleries’
include not only the rollicking rouse of the staggering
blades who ‘love their humour well, boys,’ the burlesque
of the Olympian revels in ‘Hunting the Hare,’ the wild
vagary of Tom of Bedlam, and the gibes of the Benedicks
of that day against the holy estate, but lays of a delicate
and airy beauty, a dirge or two of exquisite pathos, homely
ditties awaking patriotic memories of the Armada and the
Low Country wars, and ‘loyal cantons’ sung to the
praise and glory of King Charles. The ‘late and true
story of a furious scold’ might have enriched the budget
of Autolycus, and Feste would have found here a store of
‘love-songs,’ and a few ‘songs of good life.’ The collection
is of course highly miscellaneous. After the stately
measure may come a jig with homely ‘duck and nod,’ or
even a dissonant strain from the ‘riot and ill-managed
merriment’ of Comus,</p>

<p class="center mt3"><i>From the “Bookseller,” March, 1875.</i></p>

<p>“If we wish to read the history of public opinion we
must read the songs of the times: and those who help us
to do this confer a real favour. Mr. Thomas Wright has
done enormous service in this way by his collections of
political songs. Mr. Chappell has done better by giving
us the music with them; but much remains to be done.
On examining the volume before us, we are surprised to
find so many really beautiful pieces, and so few of the
coarse and vulgar. Even the latter will compare favourably
with the songs in vogue amongst the fast men in the
early part of the present century.</p>

<p>The “<i>Westminster Drolleries</i>” consist of two collections
of poems and songs sung at Court and theatres, the first
published in 1671, and the second in 1672. Now for the
first time reprinted. The editor, Mr. J. Woodfall
Ebsworth, has prefaced the volume with an interesting
introduction ... and, in an appendix of nearly eighty
pages at the end, has collected a considerable amount of
bibliographical and anecdotical literature. Altogether,
<i>we think this may be pronounced the best edited of all the
reprints of old literature</i>, which are now pretty numerous.
A word of commendation must also be given to Mr.
Roberts, of Boston, the publisher and printer—the volume
is a credit to his press, and could have been produced in
its all but perfect condition only by the most careful attention
and watchful oversight.”</p>

<p class="center mt3"><i>From the “Athenæum,” April 10th, 1875.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Ebsworth has, we think, made out a fair case in
his Introduction for reprinting the volume without excision.
The book is not intended <i>virginibus puerisque</i>, but
to convey to grown men a sufficient idea of the manners
and ideas which pervaded all classes in society at the
time of the reaction from the Puritan domination....
Mr. Ebsworth’s Introduction is well written. He speaks
with zest of the pleasant aspects of the Restoration
period, and has some words of praise to bestow upon the
‘Merry Monarch’ himself.... Let us add that his own
“Prelude,” “Entr’ Acte,” and “Finale” are fair specimens
of versification.”</p>

How many persecuted Christians hath she not snatched out of the

the Earl of <i>Warwick</i>; with whom he had a fast friendship, though
neither their humours, nor their natures, were like. And the Heir
of that House, who had married his youngest Daughter [Frances],
died about the same time [or, rather, two months earlier]; so
that all his relation to, or confidence in that Family was at an end;
the other branches of it abhorring his Alliance. His domestick
delights were lessened every day; he plainly discovered that his
son [in-law, who had married Mary Cromwell,] Falconbridge’s
heart was set upon an Interest destructive to his, and grew to hate
him perfectly. <i>But that which chiefly broke his Peace was the death
of his daughter [Elizabeth] Claypole</i>; who had been always his
greatest joy, and who, in her sickness, which was of a nature the
Physicians knew not how to deal with, had several Conferences
with him, which exceedingly perplexed him. Though no body
was near enough to hear the particulars, yet her often mentioning,
in the pains she endured, the blood her Father had spilt, made
people conclude, that she had presented his worst Actions to his
consideration. And though he never made the least show of
remorse for any of those Actions, it is very certain, that <i>either what
she said, or her death</i>, affected him wonderfully.” (Clarendon’s

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> For special reasons, the Editor felt it nearly impossible to
avoid the omission of a few letters in one of the most objectionable
of these pieces, the twelfth in order, of <i>Choyce Drollery</i>. He mentions
this at once, because he holds to his confirmed opinion
that in Reprints of scarce and valuable historical memorials <i>no
tampering with the original is permissible</i>. (But see <a href="#APPENDIX_4">Appendix,
Part IV.</a> and pp. <a href="#Page_230">230</a>, <a href="#Page_288">288</a>.) He incurs blame from judicious antiquaries <!-- and modern transcribers -->
by even this small and acknowledged violation of exactitude.
Probably, he might have given pleasure to the general
public if he had omitted much more, not thirty letters only, but
entire poems or songs; as the books deserved in punishment.
But he leaves others to produce expurgated editions, suitable for
unlearned triflers. Any reader can here erase from the Reprint
what offends his individual taste (as we know that Ann, Countess
of Strafford, cut out the poem of “Woman” from our copy of
Dryden’s <i>Miscellany Poems</i>, Pt. 6, 1709). <i>No Editor has any

systematically to preserve a copy of every pamphlet,
broadside, and printed book connected with the political disturbances.
Until after the Restoration in 1660, he continued his
valuable collection, so far as possible without omission, but not
without danger and interruption. In his will he speaks of it as
“not to be paralleled,” and it was intact at Oxford when he died
in 1666. Charles II. had too many feminine claimants on his
money and time to allow him to purchase the invaluable series
of printed documents, as it had been desired that he should do.
The sum of £4,000 was refused for this collection of 30,000
pamphlets, bound in 2,000 volumes; but, after several changes
of ownership, they were ultimately purchased by King George
the Third, for only three or four hundred pounds, and were presented
by him to the nation. They are in the British Museum,
known as the King’s Pamphlets, and the <i>Antidote against Melancholy</i>
is among the small quartos. See Isaac D’Israeli’s <i>Amenities

called his six volumes ‘<i>Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>,’
8vo., 1719-20.” (<i>Bibliog. &amp; Crit. Account</i>, vol. i. p. 26.)
Again, “If N. D., whose initials are at the end of the rhyming
address ‘to the Reader,’ were the person who made the selection,
we are without any other clue to his name. There is no ground
for imputing it to Thomas Jordan, excepting that he was accustomed
to deal in productions of this class; but the songs and
ballads he printed were usually of his own composition, and not
the works of anterior versifyers.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, i. 27.)</p>

days before the Coronation of Charles II. in Westminster Abbey,
April 23rd. On the 19th were the ceremonies of the Knights of
the Bath, at the Painted Chamber, and in the Chapel at Whitehall.
On the 22nd, Charles went from the Tower to Whitehall,
through well-built triumphal arches, and amid enthusiasm.</p>

to White Hall; he taking me thither on purpose to carry me into
the ball this night before the King. He brought me first to the
Duke [of York]’s chamber, where I saw him and the Duchesse at
supper; and thence into the room where the ball was to be;
crammed with fine ladies, the greatest of the Court. By and by,
comes the King and Queene, the Duke and Duchesse, and all the
great ones; and after seating themselves, the King takes out the
Duchesse of York; and the Duke, the Duchesse of Buckingham;
the Duke of Monmouth, my Lady Castlemaine; and so other lords
other ladies: and they danced the Brantle [? <i>Braule</i>]. After that
the King led a lady a single Coranto; and then the rest of the
lords, one after another, other ladies: very noble it was, and great
pleasure to see. Then to country dances; the King leading the
first, which he called for, which was, says he, ‘Cuckolds all
awry [a-row],’ the old dance of England. Of the ladies that
danced, the Duke of Monmouth’s mistress, and my Lady Castlemaine,
and a daughter of Sir Harry de Vicke’s, were the best.
The manner was, when the King dances, all the ladies in the
room, and the Queene herself, stand up: and indeed he dances
rarely, and much better than the Duke of York. Having staid
here as long as I thought fit, to my infinite content, it being the
greatest pleasure I could wish now to see at Court, I went home,
leaving them dancing.”—(<i>Diary of Samuel Pepys, Esq., F.R.S.,
Secretary to the Admiralty, &amp;c.</i>)</p>
